<b>14.1 INTRODUCTION</b><br>
Order and precedence relationships appear in many different places in mathematics and computer science.<br>
This chapter makes these notions precise.We also define a lattice, which is a special kind of an ordered set.<br><br>
<b>14.2 ORDERED SETS</b>
Suppose R is a relation on a set S satisfying the following three properties:<br>
[O1] (Reflexive) For any a ? S, we have aRa.<br>
[O2] (Antisymmetric) If aRb and bRa, then a = b.<br>
[O3] (Transitive) If aRb and bRc, then aRc.<br>
Then R is called a partial order or, simply an order relation, and R is said to define a partial ordering of S. The
set S with the partial order is called a partially ordered set or, simply, an ordered set or poset. We write (S,R)
when we want to specify the relation R.<br><br>
The most familiar order relation, called the usual order, is the relation = (read “less than or equal”) on the
positive integers N or, more generally, on any subset of the real numbers R. For this reason, a partial order relation
is usually denoted by ; and
a b<br>
is read “a precedes b.” In this case we also write:<br>
a ? b means a b and a = b; read “a strictly precedes b.”<br>
ba means a b; read “b succeeds a.”<br>
b . a means a ? b; read “b strictly succeeds a.”<br>
/, / ?, /, and . are self-explanatory.<br>
When there is no ambiguity, the symbols =, <, >, and = are frequently used instead of , ?, ., and ,
respectively.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 14.1</b><br>
(a) Let S be any collection of sets. The relation ? of set inclusion is a partial ordering of S. Specifically, A ? A
for any set A; if A ? B and B ? A then A = B; and if A ? B and B ? C then A ? C.<br>
(b) Consider the set N of positive integers. We say “a divides b,” written a | b, if there exists an integer c such
that ac = b. For example, 2 | 4, 3 | 12, 7 | 21, and so on. This relation of divisibility is a partial ordering of N.<br>
(c) The relation “|” of divisibility is not an ordering of the set Z of integers. Specifically, the relation is not
antisymmetric. For instance, 2|-2 and -2 | 2, but 2 = -2.<br>
(d) Consider the set Z of integers. Define aRb if there is a positive integer r such that b = ar . For instance, 2 R 8
since 8 = 23. Then R is a partial ordering of Z.<br><br>
<b>Dual Order</b><br>
Let be any partial ordering of a set S. The relation , that is, a succeeds b, is also a partial ordering of S;
it is called the dual order. Observe that a b if and only if ba; hence the dual order  is the inverse of the
relation , that is,  =-1.<br><br>
<b>Ordered Subsets</b><br>
Let A be a subset of an ordered set S, and suppose a, b ? A. Define a b as elements of A whenever a b as
elements of S. This defines a partial ordering of A called the induced order on A. The subset A with the induced
order is called an ordered subset of S. Unless otherwise stated or implied, any subset of an ordered set S will be
treated as an ordered subset of S.<br><br>
<b>Quasi-order</b><br>
Suppose ? is a relation on a set S satisfying the following two properties:<br>
[Q1] (Irreflexive) For any a ? A, we have a / ? a.<br>
[Q2] (Transitive) If a ? b, and b ? c, then a ? c.<br>
Then ? is called a quasi-order on S.<br>
There is a close relationship between partial orders and quasi-orders. Specifically, if  is a partial order
on a set S and we define a ? b to mean a b but a = b, then ? is a quasi-order on S. Conversely, if ? is a
quasi-order on a set S and we define a b to mean a ? b or a = b, then  is a partial order on S. This allows
us to switch back and forth between a partial order and its corresponding quasi-orders using whichever is more
convenient.<br><br>
<b>Comparability, Linearly Ordered Sets</b><br>
Suppose a and b are elements in a partially ordered set S.We say a and b are comparable if<br>
a b or ba<br>
that is, if one of them precedes the other. Thus a and b are noncomparable, written<br>
a b<br>
if neither a b nor ba.<br><br>
The word “partial” is used in defining a partially ordered set S since some of the elements of S need not be
comparable. Suppose, on the other hand, that every pair of elements of S are comparable. Then S is said to be
totally ordered or linearly ordered, and S is called a chain. Although an ordered set S may not be linearly ordered,
it is still possible for a subset A of S to be linearly ordered. Clearly, every subset of a linearly ordered set S must
also be linearly ordered.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 14.2</b><br>
(a) Consider the set N of positive integers ordered by divisibility. Then 21 and 7 are comparable since 7 | 21.
On the other hand, 3 and 5 are noncomparable since neither 3 | 5 nor 5 | 3. Thus N is not linearly ordered by
divisibility. Observe that A = {2, 6, 12, 36} is a linearly ordered subset of N since 2 | 6, 6 | 12 and 12 | 36.<br>
(b) The set N of positive integers with the usual order = (less than or equal) is linearly ordered and hence every
ordered subset of N is also linearly ordered.<br>
(c) The power set P(A) of a set A with two or more elements is not linearly ordered by set inclusion. For
instance, suppose a and b belong to A. Then {a} and {b} are noncomparable. Observe that the empty set ,
{a}, and A do form a linearly ordered subset of P(A) since  ? {a} ? A. Similarly, , {b}, and A form a
linearly ordered subset of P(A).<br><br>
<b>Product Sets and Order</b>
There are a number of ways to define an order relation on the Cartesian product of given ordered sets. Two
of these ways follow:<br>
<u>(a) Product Order:</u> Suppose S and T are ordered sets. Then the following is an order relation on the product
set S × T , called the product order:<br>
(a, b)(a

, b

) if a = a
	 and b = b

<br><u>(b) Lexicographical Order:</u> Suppose S and T are linearly ordered sets. Then the following is an order relation
on the product set S × T , called the lexicographical or dictionary order:
(a, b) ? (a

, b

) if a < b or if a = a
	 and b < b

This order can be extended to S1 × S2 ×· · ·×Sn as follows:<br>
(a1, a2, . . . , an) ? (a

1, a

2, . . . , a

n) if ai = a

i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k - 1 and ak < a

k<br>
Note that the lexicographical order is also linear.
<br><br>
<b>14.3 HASSE DIAGRAMS OF PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS</b><br>
Let S be a partially ordered set, and suppose a, b belong to S.We say that a is an immediate predecessor of
b, or that b is an immediate successor of a, or that b is a cover of a, written<br>
a / b<br>
if a < b but no element in S lies between a and b, that is, there exists no element c in S such that a < c < b.<br><br>
Suppose S is a finite partially ordered set. Then the order on S is completely known once we know all pairs
a, b in S such that a / b, that is, once we know the relation / on S. This follows from the fact that x < y if
and only if x / y or there exist elements a1, a2, . . . , am in S such that<br>
x / a1 / a2 /· · ·/am / y<br><br>
The Hasse diagram of a finite partially ordered set S is the directed graph whose vertices are the elements
of S and there is a directed edge from a to b whenever a / b in S. (Instead of drawing an arrow from a to b,
we sometimes place b higher than a and draw a line between them. It is then understood that movement upwards
indicates succession.) In the diagram thus created, there is a directed edge from vertex x to vertex y if and only
if x / y. Also, there can be no (directed) cycles in the diagram of S since the order relation is antisymmetric.<br>
The Hasse diagram of a poset S is a picture of S; hence it is very useful in describing types of elements
in S. Sometimes we define a partially ordered set by simply presenting its Hasse diagram.We note that the Hasse
diagram of a poset S need not be connected.<br><br>
<b>Remark:</b> The Hasse diagram of a finite poset S turns out to be a directed cycle-free graph (DAG) studied in
Section 9.9. The investigation here is independent of the previous investigation. Here we mainly think of order
in terms of “less than” or “greater than” rather than in terms of directed adjacency relations. Accordingly, there
will be some overlap in the content.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 14.3</b><br>
(a) Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24} be ordered by the relation “x divides y.” The diagram of A is given
in Fig. 14-1(a). (Unlike rooted trees, the direction of a line in the diagram of a poset is always upward.)<br>
(b) Let B = {a, b, c, d, e}. The diagram in Fig. 14-1(b) defines a partial order on B in the natural way. That is,
d = b, d = a, e = c and so on.<br>
(c) The diagram of a finite linearly ordered set, i.e., a finite chain, consists simply of one path. For example,
Fig. 14-1(c) shows the diagram of a chain with five elements.<br><img src="14.1.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 14.4</b> A partition of a positive integer m is a set of positive integers whose sum is m. For instance,
there are seven partitions of m = 5 as follows:<br>
5, 3 - 2, 2 - 2 - 1, 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1, 4 - 1, 3 - 1 - 1, 2 - 1 - 1 - 1<br>
We order the partitions of an integer m as follows.Apartition P1 precedes a partition P2 if the integers in P1 can
be added to obtain the integers in P2 or, equivalently, if the integers in P2 can be further subdivided to obtain the
integers in P1. For example,<br>
2 - 2 - 1 precedes 3 - 2<br>
since 2 + 1 = 3. On the other hand, 3 - 1 - 1 and 2 - 2 - 1 are noncomparable.<br>
Figure 14-2 gives the Hasse diagram of the partitions of m = 5.<br><img src="14.2.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>
<b>Minimal and Maximal, and First and Last Elements</b><br>
Let S be a partially ordered set.An element a in S is called a minimal element if no other element of S strictly
precedes (is less than) a. Similarly, an element b in S is called a maximal element if no element of S strictly
succeeds (is larger than) b. Geometrically speaking, a is a minimal element if no edge enters a (from below),
and b is a maximal element if no edge leaves b (in the upward direction).We note that S can have more than one
minimal and more than one maximal element.<br>
If S is infinite, then S may have no minimal and no maximal element. For instance, the set Z of integers with
the usual order = has no minimal and no maximal element. On the other hand, if S is finite, then S must have at
least one minimal element and at least one maximal element.<br>
An element a is S is called a first element if for every element x in S,<br>
a x<br>
that is, if a precedes every other element in S. Similarly, an element b in S is called a last element if for every
element y in S,<br>
y b<br>
that is, if b succeeds every other element in S. We note that S can have at most one first element, which must
be a minimal element, and S can have at most one last element, which must be a maximal element. Generally
speaking, S may have neither a first nor a last element, even when S is finite.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 14.5</b><br>
(a) Consider the three partially ordered sets in Example 14-3 whose Hasse diagrams appear in Fig. 14-1.<br>
<nbsp>(i) A has two maximal elements 18 and 24 and neither is a last element. A has only one minimal element, 1,
which is also a first element.<br>
<nbsp>(ii) B has two minimal elements, d and e, and neither is a first element. B has only one maximal element, a,
which is also a last element.<br>
<nbsp>(iii) The chain has one minimal element, x, which is a first element, and one maximal element, v, which is
a last element.<br><br>
(b) Let A be any nonempty set and let P(A) be the power set of A ordered by set inclusion. Then the empty set
 is a first element of P(A) since, for any set X, we have  ? X. Moreover, A is a last element of P(A)
since every element Y of P(A) is, by definition, a subset of A, that is, Y ? A.<br><br>
<b>14.5 SUPREMUM AND INFIMUM</b><br>
Let A be a subset of a partially ordered set S. An element M in S is called an upper bound of A if M succeeds
every element of A, i.e., if, for every x in A,<br>
If an upper bound of A precedes every other upper bound of A, then it is called the supremum of A and is
denoted by<br>
sup(A)<br>
We also write sup(a1,...,an) instead of sup(A) if A consists of the elements a1,...,an. We emphasize that
there can be at most one sup(A); however, sup(A) may not exist.<br>
Analogously, an element m in a poset S is called a lower bound of a subset A of S if m precedes every
element of A, i.e., if, for every y in A,<br>
If a lower bound of A succeeds every other lower bound of A, then it is called the infimum of A and is denoted by
inf(A), or inf(a1,...,an)<br><br>
if A consists of the elements a1,...,an. There can be at most one inf(A) although inf(A) may not exist.
Some texts use the term least upper bound instead of supremum and then write lub(A) instead of sup(A),
and use the term greatest lower bound instead of infimum and write glb(A) instead of inf(A).
If A has an upper bound we say A is bounded above, and if A has a lower bound we say A is bounded below.
In particular, A is bounded if A has an upper and lower bound.<br><br>
<b>14.8 LATTICES</b><br>
There are two ways to define a lattice L. One way is to define L in terms of a partially ordered set. Specifically,
a lattice L may be defined as a partially ordered set in which inf (a, b) and sup(a, b) exist for any pair of elements
a, b ? L. Another way is to define a lattice L axiomatically. This we do below.<br><br>
<b>Axioms Defining a Lattice</b><br>
Let L be a nonempty set closed under two binary operations called meet and join, denoted respectively by
? and ?. Then L is called lattice if the following axioms hold where a, b, c are elements in L:<br>
<b>[L1] Commutative law:</b><br>
(1a) a ? b = b ?a (1b) a ? b = b ? a<br>
<b>[L2] Associative law:</b><br>
(2a) (a ? b) ? c = a ? (b ? c) (2b) (a ? b) ? c = a ? (b ? c)<br>
<b>[L3] Absorption law:</b><br>
(3a) a ? (a ? b) =a (3b) a ? (a ? b) = a<br>
We will sometimes denote the lattice by (L,?,?) when we want to show which operations are involved.<br><br>
<b>Duality and the Idempotent Law</b><br>
The dual of any statement in a lattice (L,?,?) is defined to be the statement that is obtained by interchanging
? and ?. For example, the dual of<br>
a ? (b ? a) = a ? a is a ? (b ? a) = a ? a<br>
Notice that the dual of each axiom of a lattice is also an axiom. Accordingly, the principle of duality holds;
that is:<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.2 (Principle of Duality):</b> The dual of any theorem in a lattice is also a theorem.<br>
This follows from the fact that the dual theorem can be proven by using the dual of each step of the proof of
the original theorem.<br>
An important property of lattices follows directly from the absorption laws.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.3 (Idempotent Law):</b> (i) a ? a = a; (ii) a ? a = a.<br>
The proof of (i) requires only two lines:<br>
a ? a = a ? (a ? (a ? b)) (using (3b))<br>
=a (using (3a))<br>
The proof of (ii) follows from the above principle of duality (or can be proved in a similar manner).<br><br>
<b>Lattices and Order</b><br>
Given a lattice L, we can define a partial order on L as follows:<br>
a b if a ? b = a<br>
Analogously, we could define<br>
a b if a ? b = b<br>
We state these results in a theorem.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.4:</b> Let L be a lattice. Then:<br>
(i) a ? b = a if and only if a ? b = b.<br>
(ii) The relation a b (defined by a ? b = a or a ? b = b) is a partial order on L.<br>
Now that we have a partial order on any lattice L, we can picture L by a diagram as was done for partially
ordered sets in general.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 14.10</b> Let C be a collection of sets closed under intersection and union. Then (C,n,?) is a lattice.
In this lattice, the partial order relation is the same as the set inclusion relation. Figure 14-6 shows the diagram
of the lattice L of all subsets of {a, b, c}.<br>
<img src="14.6.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>

We have shown how to define a partial order on a lattice L. The next theorem tells us when we can define a
lattice on a partially ordered set P such that the lattice will give back the original order on P.<br><br>

<b>Theorem 14.5:</b> Let P be a poset such that the inf (a, b) and sup(a, b) exist for any a, b in P. Letting
a ? b = inf (a, b) and a ? b = sup(a, b)<br>
we have that (P,?,?) is a lattice. Furthermore, the partial order on P induced by the lattice is
the same as the original partial order on P.<br><br>
The converse of the above theorem is also true. That is, let L be a lattice and let  be the induced partial order
on L. Then inf (a, b) and sup(a, b) exist for any pair a, b in L and the lattice obtained from the poset (L, ) is
the original lattice. Accordingly, we have the following:<br><br>
<b>Alternate Definition:</b> A lattice is a partially ordered set in which<br>
a ? b = inf (a, b) and a ? b = sup(a, b)<br>
exist for any pair of elements a and b.<br>
We note first that any linearly ordered set is a lattice since inf (a, b) = a and sup(a, b) = b whenever<br>
a b. By Example 14.7, the positive integers N and the set Dm of divisors of m are lattices under the relation of
divisibility.<br><br>
<b>Sublattices, Isomorphic Lattices</b><br>
Suppose M is a nonempty subset of a lattice L. We say M is a sublattice of L if M itself is a lattice (with
respect to the operations of L).We note thatM is a sublattice of L if and only ifM is closed under the operations of
? and ? of L. For example, the set Dm of divisors of m is a sublattice of the positive integers N under divisibility.<br><br>
Two lattices L and L
	 are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence f: L ? L
	 such that<br>
f (a ? b) = f (a) ? f (b) and f (a ? b) = f (a) ? f (b)<br>
for any elements a, b in L.<br><br>
<b>14.9 BOUNDED LATTICES</b><br>
A lattice L is said to have a lower bound 0 if for any element x in L we have 0x. Analogously, L is said
to have an upper bound I if for any x in L we have x I . We say L is bounded if L has both a lower bound 0
and an upper bound I . In such a lattice we have the identities<br>
a ? I = I, a ? I = a, a ? 0 = a, a ? 0 = 0<br>
for any element a in L.<br>
The nonnegative integers with the usual ordering,<br>
0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < · · ·<br>
have 0 as a lower bound but have no upper bound. On the other hand, the lattice P(U) of all subsets of any
universal set U is a bounded lattice with U as an upper bound and the empty set  as a lower bound.<br>
Suppose L = {a1, a2, . . . , an} is a finite lattice. Then<br>
a1 ? a2 ? · · · ? an and a1 ? a2 ? · · · ? an<br>
are upper and lower bounds for L, respectively. Thus we have<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.6:</b> Every finite lattice L is bounded.<br><br>

<b>14.10 DISTRIBUTIVE LATTICES</b><br>
A lattice L is said to be distributive if for any elements a, b, c in L we have the following:<br>
[L4] Distributive law:<br><br>
(4a) a ? (b ? c) = (a ? b) ? (a ? c) (4b) a ? (b ? c) = (a ? b) ? (a ? c)<br>
Otherwise, L is said to be nondistributive.We note that by the principle of duality the condition (4a) holds if and
only if (4b) holds.<br>
Figure 14-7(a) is a nondistributive lattice since<br>
a ? (b ? c) = a ? 0 = a but (a ? b) ? (a ? c) = I ? c = c<br>
Figure 14-7(b) is also a nondistributive lattice. In fact, we have the following characterization of such lattices.
<br><img src="14.7.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>
Theorem 14.7: Alattice L is nondistributive if and only if it contains a sublattice isomorphic to Fig. 14-7(a) or
to Fig. 14.7(b).<br>
The proof of this theorem lies beyond the scope of this text.<br><br>
<b>Join Irreducible Elements, Atoms</b><br>
Let L be a lattice with a lower bound 0. An element a in L is said to be join irreducible if a = x ? y implies
a = x or a = y. (Prime numbers under multiplication have this property, i.e., if p = ab then p = a or p = b
where p is prime.) Clearly 0 is join irreducible. If a has at least two immediate predecessors, say, b1 and b2 as in
Fig. 14-8(a), then a = b1 ? b2, and so a is not join irreducible. On the other hand, if a has a unique immediate
predecessor c, then a = sup(b1, b2) = b1 ? b2 for any other elements b1 and b2 because c would lie between the
b’s and a as in Fig. 14-8(b). In other words, a = 0, is join irreducible if and only if a has a unique immediate
predecessor. Those elements which immediately succeed 0, called atoms, are join irreducible. However, lattices
can have other join irreducible elements. For example, the element c in Fig. 14-7(a) is not an atom but is join
irreducible since a is its only immediate predecessor.
<br><img src="14.8.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>
If an element a in a finite lattice L is not join irreducible, then we can write a = b1 ? b2. Then we can write
b1 and b2 as the join of other elements if they are not join irreducible; and so on. Since L is finite we finally have<br>
a = d1 ? d2 ? · · · ? dn<br>
where the d’s are join irreducible. If di precedes dj then di ?dj = dj ; so we can delete the di from the expression.
In other words, we can assume that the d’s are irredundant, i.e., no d precedes any other d. We emphasize that
such an expression need not be unique, e.g., I = a ? b and I = b ? c in both lattices in Fig. 14-7.We now state
the main theorem of this section (proved in Problem 14.28.)<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.8:</b> Let L be a finite distributive lattice. Then every a in L can be written uniquely (except for order)
as the join of irredundant join irreducible elements.<br>
Actually this theorem can be generalized to lattices with finite length, i.e., where all linearly ordered subsets
are finite. (Problem 14.30 gives an infinite lattice with finite length.)<br><br>
<b>14.11 COMPLEMENTS, COMPLEMENTED LATTICES</b><br>
Let L be a bounded lattice with lower bound 0 and upper bound I . Let a be an element of L. An element x
in L is called a complement of a if<br>
a ? x = I and a ? x = 0<br>
Complements need not exist and need not be unique. For example, the elements a and c are both complements
of b in Fig. 14-7(a). Also, the elements y, z, and u in the chain in Fig. 14-1 have no complements. We have the
following result.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.9:</b> Let L be a bounded distributive lattice. Then complements are unique if they exist.<br>
<b>Proof:</b> Suppose x and y are complements of any element a in L. Then<br>

AlatticeLis said to be complemented ifLis bounded and every element inLhas a complement. Figure 14-7(b)
shows a complemented lattice where complements are not unique. On the other hand, the latticeP(U) of all subsets
of a universal set U is complemented, and each subset A of U has the unique complement Ac = U\A.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.10:</b> Let L be a complemented lattice with unique complements. Then the join irreducible elements
of L, other than 0, are its atoms.<br><br>
Combining this theorem and Theorems 14.8 and 14.9, we get an important result.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 14.11:</b> Let L be a finite complemented distributive lattice. Then every element a in L is the join of a
unique set of atoms.<br><br>
<b>Remark:</b> Sometexts define a latticeLto be complemented if each a inLhas a unique complement.Theorem 14.10
is then stated differently.<br><br><br>
