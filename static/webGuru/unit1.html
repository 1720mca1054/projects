  <b><u>SET THEORY</u></b></h1>
<p><b>1.1 INTRODUCTION</b><br>
The concept of a set appears in all mathematics. This chapter introduces the notation and terminology of set
theory which is basic and used throughout the text. The chapter closes with the formal definition of mathematical
induction, with examples.<br><br>
<b>1.2 SETS AND ELEMENTS, SUBSETS</b><br>
A set may be viewed as any well-defined collection of objects, called the elements or members of the set.
One usually uses capital letters, A,B,X, Y, . . . , to denote sets, and lowercase letters, a, b, x, y, . . ., to denote
elements of sets. Synonyms for “set” are “class,” “collection,” and “family.”
Membership in a set is denoted as follows:<br>
a ? S denotes that a belongs to a set S<br>
a, b ? S denotes that a and b belong to a set S<br>
Here ? is the symbol meaning “is an element of.”We use ? to mean “is not an element of.”<br><br>
<b>Specifying Sets</b><br>
There are essentially two ways to specify a particular set. One way, if possible, is to list its members separated
by commas and contained in braces { }.Asecond way is to state those properties which characterized the elements
in the set. Examples illustrating these two ways are:
A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = {x | x is an even integer, x > 0}
That is, A consists of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The second set, which reads:
B is the set of x such that x is an even integer and x is greater than 0,
denotes the set B whose elements are the positive integers. Note that a letter, usually x, is used to denote a typical
member of the set; and the vertical line | is read as “such that” and the comma as “and.”<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.1</b><br>
(a) The set A above can also be written as A = {x | x is an odd positive integer, x < 10}.<br>
(b) We cannot list all the elements of the above set B although frequently we specify the set by
B = {2, 4, 6, . . .}
where we assume that everyone knows what we mean. Observe that 8 ? B, but 3 /? B.<br>
(c) Let E = {x | x2 - 3x + 2 = 0}, F = {2, 1} and G = {1, 2, 2, 1}. Then E = F = G.<br>
We emphasize that a set does not depend on the way in which its elements are displayed. A set remains the
same if its elements are repeated or rearranged.<br>
Even if we can list the elements of a set, it may not be practical to do so. That is, we describe a set by listing its
elements only if the set contains a few elements; otherwise we describe a set by the property which characterizes
its elements.<br><br>
<b>Subsets</b><br>
Suppose every element in a set A is also an element of a set B, that is, suppose a ? A implies a ? B. Then
A is called a subset of B.We also say that A is contained in B or that B contains A. This relationship is written
A ? B or B ? A<br>
Two sets are equal if they both have the same elements or, equivalently, if each is contained in the other. That is:<br>
A = B if and only if A ? B and B ? A<br>
If A is not a subset of B, that is, if at least one element of A does not belong to B, we write A ? B.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.2</b><br> Consider the sets:<br>
A = {1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}, B= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, C= {1, 3}.<br>
Then C ? A and C ? B since 1 and 3, the elements of C, are also members of A and B. But B ? A since some
of the elements of B, e.g., 2 and 5, do not belong to A. Similarly, A ? B.<br><br>
<b><u>Property 1:</u></b> It is common practice in mathematics to put a vertical line “|” or slanted line “/” through a symbol
to indicate the opposite or negative meaning of a symbol.<br>
<b><u>Property 2:</u></b> The statement A ? B does not exclude the possibility that A = B. In fact, for every set A we have
A ? A since, trivially, every element in A belongs to A. However, if A ? B and A = B, then we say A is a
proper subset of B (sometimes written A ? B).<br>
<b><u>Property 3:</u></b> Suppose every element of a set A belongs to a set B and every element of B belongs to a set C.<br>
Then clearly every element of A also belongs to C. In other words, if A ? B and B ? C, then A ? C.<br>
The above remarks yield the following theorem.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 1.1:</b> Let A, B, C be any sets. Then:<br>
(i) A ? A<br>
(ii) If A ? B and B ? A, then A = B<br>
(iii) If A ? B and B ? C, then A ? C<br><br>
<b>Special symbols</b><br>
Some sets will occur very often in the text, and so we use special symbols for them. Some such symbols are:<br>
N = the set of natural numbers or positive integers: 1, 2, 3, . . .<br>
Z = the set of all integers: . . . ,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, . . .<br>
Q = the set of rational numbers<br>
R = the set of real numbers<br>
C = the set of complex numbers<br>
Observe that N ? Z ? Q ? R ? C.<br><br>
<b>Universal Set, Empty Set</b><br>
All sets under investigation in any application of set theory are assumed to belong to some fixed large set
called the universal set which we denote by:<b>U</b><br>
unless otherwise stated or implied.<br><br>
Given a universal set U and a property P, there may not be any elements of U which have property P. For
example, the following set has no elements:<br>
S = {x | x is a positive integer, x2 = 3}<br>
Such a set with no elements is called the empty set or null set and is denoted by:<b>Ø</b><br>
There is only one empty set. That is, if S and T are both empty, then S = T , since they have exactly the same
elements, namely, none.<br>
The empty set Ø is also regarded as a subset of every other set. Thus we have the following simple result
which we state formally.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 1.2:</b> For any set A, we have Ø ? A ? U.<br><br>
<b>Disjoint Sets</b><br>
Two sets A and B are said to be disjoint if they have no elements in common.<br>
For example, suppose<br>
A = {1, 2}, B= {4, 5, 6}, and C = {5, 6, 7, 8}<br>
Then A and B are disjoint, and A and C are disjoint. But B and C are not disjoint since B and C have elements
in common, e.g., 5 and 6.We note that if A and B are disjoint, then neither is a subset of the other (unless one is
the empty set).<br><br>
<b>1.3 VENN DIAGRAMS</b><br>
A Venn diagram is a pictorial representation of sets in which sets are represented by enclosed areas in the
plane. The universal set U is represented by the interior of a rectangle, and the other sets are represented by disks
lying within the rectangle. If A ? B, then the disk representing A will be entirely within the disk representing B
as in Fig. 1-1(a). If A and B are disjoint, then the disk representing A will be separated from the disk representing
B as in Fig. 1-1(b).<br><br>

<img src="1.png.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<br><br>

However, if A and B are two arbitrary sets, it is possible that some objects are in A but not in B, some are
in B but not in A, some are in both A and B, and some are in neither A nor B, hence in general we represent A
and B as in Fig. 1-1(c).<br><br>
<b>Arguments and Venn Diagrams</b><br>
Many verbal statements are essentially statements about sets and can therefore be described byVenn diagrams.<br>
Hence Venn diagrams can sometimes be used to determine whether or not an argument is valid.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.3</b> Show that the following argument (adapted from a book on logic by Lewis Carroll, the author
of Alice in Wonderland) is valid:<br>
S1: All my tin objects are saucepans.<br>
S2: I find all your presents very useful.<br>
S3: None of my saucepans is of the slightest use.<br>
S : Your presents to me are not made of tin.<br>
The statements S1, S2, and S3 above the horizontal line denote the assumptions, and the statement S below
the line denotes the conclusion. The argument is valid if the conclusion S follows logically from the assumptions
S1, S2, and S3.<br>
By S1 the tin objects are contained in the set of saucepans, and by S3 the set of saucepans and the set of
useful things are disjoint. Furthermore, by S2 the set of “your presents” is a subset of the set of useful things.<br>
Accordingly, we can draw the Venn diagram in Fig. 1-2.<br><img src="1.2.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>
The conclusion is clearly valid by the Venn diagram because the set of “your presents” is disjoint from the
set of tin objects.<br><br>



<b>1.4 SET OPERATIONS</b><br>
This section introduces a number of set operations, including the basic operations of union, intersection, and
complement.<br><br>
<b>Union and Intersection</b><br>
The union of two sets A and B, denoted by A ? B, is the set of all elements which belong to A or to B,
that is,<br>
A ? B = {x | x ? A or x ? B}<br>
Here “or” is used in the sense of and/or. Figure 1-3(a) is a Venn diagram in which A ? B is shaded.<br>
The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A n B, is the set of elements which belong to both A and
B; that is,<br>
A n B = {x | x ? A and x ? B}<br>
Figure 1-3(b) is a Venn diagram in which A n B is shaded.<br><br>
<br><img src="1.3.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>
Recall that sets A and B are said to be disjoint or nonintersecting if they have no elements in common or,
using the definition of intersection, if A n B = Ø, the empty set. Suppose<br>
S = A ? B and A n B = Ø<br>
Then S is called the disjoint union of A and B.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.4</b><br>
(a) Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, C = {2, 3, 8, 9}. Then<br>
A ? B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, A? C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}, B? C = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9},
A n B = {3, 4}, An C = {2, 3}, Bn C = {3}.<br>
(b) Let U be the set of students at a university, and letM denote the set of male students and let F denote the set
of female students. The U is the disjoint union of M of F, that is,<br>
U = M ? F and M n F = Ø<br>
This comes from the fact that every student in U is either in M or in F, and clearly no student belongs to
both M and F, that is, M and F are disjoint.<br>
The following properties of union and intersection should be noted.<br><br>
<b><u>Property 1:</u></b> Every element x in AnB belongs to both A and B; hence x belongs to A and x belongs to B. Thus
A n B is a subset of A and of B; namely<br>
A n B ? A and A n B ? B<br><br>
<b><u>Property 2:</u></b> An element x belongs to the union A? B if x belongs to A or x belongs to B; hence every element
in A belongs to A ? B, and every element in B belongs to A ? B. That is,<br>
A ? A ? B and B ? A ? B<br>
We state the above results formally:<br><br>
<b>Theorem 1.3:</b> For any sets A and B, we have:<br>
(i) A n B ? A ? A ? B and (ii) A n B ? B ? A ? B.<br>
The operation of set inclusion is closely related to the operations of union and intersection, as shown by the
following theorem.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 1.4:</b> The following are equivalent: A ? B, A n B = A, A ? B = B.<br>
This theorem is proved in Problem 1.8. Other equivalent conditions to are given in Problem 1.31.<br><br>
<img src="1.4.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">

<br>
<b>Complements, Differences, Symmetric Differences</b><br>
Recall that all sets under consideration at a particular time are subsets of a fixed universal set U. The absolute
complement or, simply, complement of a set A, denoted by AC, is the set of elements which belong to U but which
do not belong to A. That is,<br>
AC = {x | x ? U, x /? A}<br>
Some texts denote the complement of A by  or A¯. Fig. 1-4(a) is a Venn diagram in which AC is shaded.
The relative complement of a set B with respect to a set A or, simply, the difference of A and B, denoted by
A\B, is the set of elements which belong to A but which do not belong to B; that is<br>
A\B = {x | x ? A, x /? B}<br>
The set A\B is read “A minus B.” Many texts denote A\B by A - B or A ~ B. Fig. 1-4(b) is a Venn diagram in
which A\B is shaded.<br>
The symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted by A ? B, consists of those elements which belong to A
or B but not to both. That is,<br>
A ? B = (A ? B)\(A n B) or A ? B = (A\B) ? (B\A)<br><br>
Figure 1-4(c) is a Venn diagram in which A ? B is shaded.<br><br>

<b>EXAMPLE 1.5</b> Suppose U = N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} is the universal set. Let<br>
A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B= {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, C= {2, 3, 8, 9}, E= {2, 4, 6, . . .}<br>
(Here E is the set of even integers.) Then:<br>
AC = {5, 6, 7, . . .}, BC = {1, 2, 8, 9, 10, . . .}, EC = {1, 3, 5, 7, . . .}<br>
That is, EC is the set of odd positive integers. Also:<br>
A\B = {1, 2}, A\C = {1, 4}, B\C = {4, 5, 6, 7}, A\E = {1, 3},<br>
B\A = {5, 6, 7}, C\A = {8, 9}, C\B = {2, 8, 9}, E\A = {6, 8, 10, 12, . . .}.<br>
Furthermore:<br>
A ? B = (A\B) ? (B\A) = {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}, B? C = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9},<br>
A ? C = (A\C) ? (B\C) = {1, 4, 8, 9}, A? E = {1, 3, 6, 8, 10, . . .}.<br><br>
<b>Fundamental Products</b><br>
Consider n distinct sets A1, A2, …, An. A fundamental product of the sets is a set of the form<br>
A*1 n A*2 n . . . n A*n where A*i = A or A*i = AC<br>

We note that:<br>
<nbsp><nbsp>(i) There are m = 2n such fundamental products.<br>
<nbsp><nbsp>(ii) Any two such fundamental products are disjoint.<br>
<nbsp><nbsp>(iii) The universal set U is the union of all fundamental products.<br>
Thus U is the disjoint union of the fundamental products (Problem 1.60). There is a geometrical description
of these sets which is illustrated below.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.6</b> Figure 1-5(a) is the Venn diagram of three sets A, B, C. The following lists the m = 23 = 8
fundamental products of the sets A, B, C:<br>
P1 = A n B n C, P3 = A n BC n C, P5 = AC n B n C, P7 = AC n BC n C,<br>
P2 = A n B n CC, P4 = A n BC n CC, P6 = AC n B n CC, P8 = AC n BC n CC.<br>
The eight products correspond precisely to the eight disjoint regions in the Venn diagram of sets A, B, C as
indicated by the labeling of the regions in Fig. 1-5(b).<br><br>

<b>1.5 ALGEBRA OF SETS, DUALITY</b><br>
Sets under the operations of union, intersection, and complement satisfy various laws (identities) which are
listed in Table 1-1. In fact, we formally state this as:<br><br>
<b>Theorem 1.5:</b> Sets satisfy the laws in Table 1-1.<br><br>

</table><br><br>

<br><b>Remark:</b> Each law in Table 1-1 follows from an equivalent logical law. Consider, for example, the proof of
DeMorgan’s Law 10(a):<br>
(A ? B)C = {x |x /? (A or B)} = {x |x /? A and x /? B} = AC n BC<br>
Here we use the equivalent (DeMorgan’s) logical law:<br>
¬(p ? q) = ¬p ?¬q<br>
where ¬ means “not,” ? means “or,” and ? means “and.” (Sometimes Venn diagrams are used to illustrate the
laws in Table 1-1 as in Problem 1.17.)<br><br>
<b>Duality</b><br>
The identities in Table 1-1 are arranged in pairs, as, for example, (2a) and (2b).We now consider the principle
behind this arrangement. Suppose E is an equation of set algebra. The dual E* of E is the equation obtained by
replacing each occurrence of ?, n, U and Ø in E by n, ?, Ø, and U, respectively. For example, the dual of<br>
(U n A) ? (B n A) = A is (Ø ? A) n (B ? A) = A<br>
Observe that the pairs of laws in Table 1-1 are duals of each other. It is a fact of set algebra, called the principle
of duality, that if any equation E is an identity then its dual E* is also an identity.<br><br>
<b>1.6 FINITE SETS, COUNTING PRINCIPLE</b><br>
Sets can be finite or infinite.Aset S is said to be finite if S is empty or if S contains exactly m elements where
m is a positive integer; otherwise S is infinite.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.7</b><br>
(a) The setAof the letters of the English alphabet and the setD of the days of the week are finite sets. Specifically,
A has 26 elements and D has 7 elements.<br.
(b) Let E be the set of even positive integers, and let I be the unit interval, that is,<br>
E = {2, 4, 6, . . .} and I = [0, 1] = {x | 0 = x = 1}<br>
Then both E and I are infinite.<br><br>
A set S is countable if S is finite or if the elements of S can be arranged as a sequence, in which case S is
said to be countably infinite; otherwise S is said to be uncountable. The above set E of even integers is countably
infinite, whereas one can prove that the unit interval I = [0, 1] is uncountable.<br><br>
<b>Counting Elements in Finite Sets</b><br>
The notation n(S) or |S| will denote the number of elements in a set S. (Some texts use #(S) or card(S)
instead of n(S).) Thus n(A) = 26, where A is the letters in the English alphabet, and n(D) = 7, where D is the
days of the week. Also n(Ø) = 0 since the empty set has no elements.<br>
The following lemma applies.<br><br>
<b>Lemma 1.6:</b> Suppose A and B are finite disjoint sets. Then A ? B is finite and<br>
n(A ? B) = n(A) + n(B)<br>
This lemma may be restated as follows:<br><br>
<b>Lemma 1.6:</b> Suppose S is the disjoint union of finite sets A and B. Then S is finite and<br>
n(S) = n(A) + n(B)<br><br>
<b>Proof.</b> In counting the elements of A ? B, first count those that are in A. There are n(A) of these. The only other
elements of A ? B are those that are in B but not in A. But since A and B are disjoint, no element of B is in A,
so there are n(B) elements that are in B but not in A.<br> Therefore, n(A ? B) = n(A) + n(B).<br>
For any sets A and B, the set A is the disjoint union of A\B and A n B. Thus Lemma 1.6 gives us the
following useful result.<br><br>
<b>Corollary 1.7:</b> Let A and B be finite sets. Then<br>
n(A\B) = n(A) - n(A n B)<br>
For example, suppose an art class A has 25 students and 10 of them are taking a biology class B. Then the number
of students in class A which are not in class B is:<br>
n(A\B) = n(A) - n(A n B) = 25 - 10 = 15<br>
Given any set A, recall that the universal set U is the disjoint union of A and AC. Accordingly, Lemma 1.6
also gives the following result.<br><br>
<b>Corollary 1.8:</b> Let A be a subset of a finite universal set U. Then<br>
n(AC) = n(U) - n(A)<br>
For example, suppose a class U with 30 students has 18 full-time students. Then there are 30-18 = 12 part-time
students in the class U.<br><br>
<b>Inclusion–Exclusion Principle</b><br>
There is a formula for n(A ? B) even when they are not disjoint, called the Inclusion–Exclusion Principle.
Namely:<br><br>
<b>Theorem (Inclusion–Exclusion Principle) 1.9:</b> Suppose A and B are finite sets. Then A ? B and A n B are
finite and<br>
n(A ? B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A n B)<br>
That is, we find the number of elements in A or B (or both) by first adding n(A) and n(B) (inclusion) and then
subtracting n(A n B) (exclusion) since its elements were counted twice.<br>
We can apply this result to obtain a similar formula for three sets:<br><br>
<b>Corollary 1.10:</b> Suppose A, B, C are finite sets. Then A ? B ? C is finite and<br>
n(A ? B ? C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A n B) - n(A n C) - n(B n C) + n(A n B n C)<br>
Mathematical induction (Section 1.8) may be used to further generalize this result to any number of finite sets.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.8</b> Suppose a list A contains the 30 students in a mathematics class, and a list B contains the
35 students in an English class, and suppose there are 20 names on both lists. Find the number of students:<br>
(a) only on list A, (b) only on list B, (c) on list A or B (or both), (d) on exactly one list.<br>
(a) List A has 30 names and 20 are on list B; hence 30 - 20 = 10 names are only on list A.<br>
(b) Similarly, 35 - 20 = 15 are only on list B.<br>
(c) We seek n(A ? B). By inclusion–exclusion,<br>
n(A ? B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A n B) = 30 + 35 - 20 = 45.<br>
In other words, we combine the two lists and then cross out the 20 names which appear twice.<br>
(d) By (a) and (b), 10 + 15 = 25 names are only on one list; that is, n(A ? B) = 25.<br><br>

<b>1.7 CLASSES OF SETS, POWER SETS, PARTITIONS</b><br>
Given a set S, we might wish to talk about some of its subsets. Thus we would be considering a set of sets.<br>
Whenever such a situation occurs, to avoid confusion, we will speak of a class of sets or collection of sets rather
than a set of sets. If we wish to consider some of the sets in a given class of sets, then we speak of subclass or
subcollection.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.9</b> Suppose S = {1, 2, 3, 4}.<br>
(a) Let A be the class of subsets of S which contain exactly three elements of S. Then<br>
A = [{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}]<br>
That is, the elements of A are the sets {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, and {2, 3, 4}<br>
(b) Let B be the class of subsets of S, each which contains 2 and two other elements of S. Then<br>
B = [{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 4}]<br>
The elements of B are the sets {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, and {2, 3, 4}. Thus B is a subclass of A, since every
element of B is also an element of A. (To avoid confusion, we will sometimes enclose the sets of a class in
brackets instead of braces.)<br><br>
<b>Power Sets</b><br>
For a given set S , we may speak of the class of all subsets of S. This class is called the power set of S , and
will be denoted by P(S). If S is finite, then so is P(S). In fact, the number of elements in P(S) is 2 raised to the
power n(S). That is,<br>
n(P (S)) = 2n(S)<br>
(For this reason, the power set of S is sometimes denoted by 2S.)<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.10</b> Suppose S = {1, 2, 3}. Then<br>
P(S) = [Ø, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, S]<br>
Note that the empty set Ø belongs to P(S) since Ø is a subset of S. Similarly, S belongs to P(S). As expected
from the above remark, P(S) has 23 = 8 elements.<br><br>
<b>Partitions</b>
Let S be a nonempty set. A partition of S is a subdivision of S into nonoverlapping, nonempty subsets.<br>
Precisely, a partition of S is a collection {Ai } of nonempty subsets of S such that:<br>
(i) Each a in S belongs to one of the Ai .<br>
(ii) The sets of {Ai } are mutually disjoint; that is, if<br>
Aj = Ak then Aj n Ak = Ø<br>
The subsets in a partition are called cells. Figure 1-6 is a Venn diagram of a partition of the rectangular set
S of points into five cells, A1, A2,A3,A4,A5.<br><br>

<img src="1.6.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.11</b> Consider the following collections of subsets of S = {1, 2, . . ., 8, 9}:<br>
(i) [{1, 3, 5}, {2, 6}, {4, 8, 9}]<br>
(ii) [{1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6, 8}, {5, 7, 9}]<br>
(iii) [{1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6, 8}, {7, 9}]<br>
Then (i) is not a partition of S since 7 in S does not belong to any of the subsets. Furthermore, (ii) is not a
partition of S since {1, 3, 5} and {5, 7, 9} are not disjoint. On the other hand, (iii) is a partition of S.
<br><br>
<b>Generalized Set Operations</b><br>
The set operations of union and intersection were defined above for two sets. These operations can be extended
to any number of sets, finite or infinite, as follows.<br>
Consider first a finite number of sets, say, A1,A2, . . .,Am. The union and intersection of these sets are
denoted and defined, respectively, by<br>
A1 ? A2 ? . . . ? Am =
m
i=1 Ai = {x | x ? Ai for some Ai }
A1 n A2 n . . . n Am =
m
i=1 Ai = {x | x ? Ai for every Ai }<br>
That is, the union consists of those elements which belong to at least one of the sets, and the intersection consists
of those elements which belong to all the sets.<br>
Now let A be any collection of sets. The union and the intersection of the sets in the collection A is denoted
and defined, respectively, by<br>

(A|A ? A ) = {x | x ? Ai for some Ai ? A }<br>
(A|A ? A ) = {x | x ? Ai for every Ai ? A }<br>
That is, the union consists of those elements which belong to at least one of the sets in the collection A and the
intersection consists of those elements which belong to every set in the collection A.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.12</b> Consider the sets<br>
A1 = {1, 2, 3, . . .} = N, A2 = {2, 3, 4, . . .}, A3 = {3, 4, 5, . . .}, An = {n, n + 1, n + 2, . . .}.<br>
Then the union and intersection of the sets are as follows:<br>

(Ak | k ? N) = N and<br>

(Ak | k ? N) = Ø<br>
DeMorgan’s laws also hold for the above generalized operations. That is:<br><br>
<b>Theorem 1.11:</b> Let A be a collection of sets. Then:<br>

<b>1.8 MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION</b><br>
An essential property of the set N = {1, 2, 3, …} of positive integers follows:<br><br>
<b>Principle of Mathematical Induction I</b>: Let P be a proposition defined on the positive integers N; that is, P(n)
is either true or false for each n ? N. Suppose P has the following two properties:<br>
(i) P(1) is true.<br>
(ii) P(k + 1) is true whenever P(k) is true.<br>
Then P is true for every positive integer n ? N.<br>
We shall not prove this principle. In fact, this principle is usually given as one of the axioms when N is
developed axiomatically.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 1.13</b> Let P be the proposition that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n<sup>2</sup>; that is,<br>
P(n) : 1 + 3 + 5+· · ·+(2n - 1) = n<sup>2</sup><br>
(The kth odd number is 2k -1, and the next odd number is 2k +1.) Observe that P(n) is true for n = 1; namely,
P(1) = 12<br>
Assuming P(k) is true, we add 2k + 1 to both sides of P(k), obtaining
1 + 3 + 5+· · ·+(2k - 1) + (2k + 1) - k2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)2<br>
which is P(k + 1). In other words, P(k + 1) is true whenever P(k) is true. By the principle of mathematical
induction, P is true for all n.<br><br>
There is a form of the principle of mathematical induction which is sometimes more convenient to use.
Although it appears different, it is really equivalent to the above principle of induction.<br><br>
<b>Principle of Mathematical Induction II:</b> Let P be a proposition defined on the positive integers N such that:<br>
(i) P(1) is true.<br>
(ii) P(k) is true whenever P(j) is true for all 1 = j < k.<br>
Then P is true for every positive integer n ? N.<br><br>
<b>Remark:</b> Sometimes one wants to prove that a proposition P is true for the set of integers<br>
{a, a + 1, a + 2, a + 3, . . .}<br>
where a is any integer, possibly zero. This can be done by simply replacing 1 by a in either of the above Principles
of Mathematical Induction.<br>

<h1 style="text-align:left;"><b><u>Relations</u></b></h1><br><p><b>2.1 INTRODUCTION</b><br>
The reader is familiar with many relations such as “less than,” “is parallel to,” “is a subset of,” and so on.
In a certain sense, these relations consider the existence or nonexistence of a certain connection between pairs
of objects taken in a definite order. Formally, we define a relation in terms of these “ordered pairs.”<br>
An ordered pair of elements a and b, where a is designated as the first element and b as the second element,
is denoted by (a, b). In particular,<br>
(a, b) = (c, d)<br>
if and only if a = c and b = d. Thus (a, b) = (b, a) unless a = b. This contrasts with sets where the order of
elements is irrelevant; for example, {3, 5} = {5, 3}.<br><br>
<b>2.2 PRODUCT SETS</b><br>
Consider two arbitrary sets A and B. The set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ? A and b ? B is called
the product, or Cartesian product, of A and B. A short designation of this product is A × B, which is read
“A cross B.” By definition,<br>
A × B = {(a, b) | a ? A and b ? B}<br>
One frequently writes A2 instead of A × A.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.1</b> R denotes the set of real numbers and so R2 = R×R is the set of ordered pairs of real numbers.
The reader is familiar with the geometrical representation of R2 as points in the plane as in Fig. 2-1. Here each
point P represents an ordered pair (a, b) of real numbers and vice versa; the vertical line through P meets the
x-axis at a, and the horizontal line through P meets the y-axis at b. R2 is frequently called the <i>Cartesian plane.</i><br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.2</b> Let A = {1, 2} and B = {a, b, c}. Then<br>
A × B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}<br>
B × A = {(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c, 2)}<br>
Also, A × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}<br>
<img src="2.1.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>

There are two things worth noting in the above examples. First of all A×B = B ×A. The Cartesian product
deals with ordered pairs, so naturally the order in which the sets are considered is important. Secondly, using
n(S) for the number of elements in a set S, we have:<br>
n(A × B) = 6 = 2(3) = n(A)n(B)<br>
In fact, n(A×B) = n(A)n(B) for any finite sets A and B. This follows from the observation that, for an ordered
pair (a, b) in A × B, there are n(A) possibilities for a, and for each of these there are n(B) possibilities for b.
The idea of a product of sets can be extended to any finite number of sets. For any sets A1,A2, . . . , An, the
set of all ordered n-tuples (a1, a2, . . . , an) where a1 ? A1, a2 ? A2, . . . , an ? An is called the product of the sets
A1, . . . , An and is denoted by<br>
A1 × A2 ×· · ·×An or
	n
i=1
A1<br>
Just as we write A<sup>2</sup> instead of A × A, so we write An instead of A × A×· · ·×A, where there are n factors all
equal to A. For example, R3 = R × R × R denotes the usual three-dimensional space.<br><br>
<b>2.3 RELATIONS</b><br>
We begin with a definition.<br>
<b>Definition 2.1:</b> Let A and B be sets. A binary relation or, simply, relation from A to B is a subset of A × B.<br>
Suppose R is a relation from A to B. Then R is a set of ordered pairs where each first element comes from
A and each second element comes from B. That is, for each pair a ? A and b ? B, exactly one of the following
is true:<br>
(i) (a, b) ? R; we then say “a is R-related to b”, written aRb.<br>
(ii) (a, b) /? R; we then say “a is not R-related to b”, written aRb.<br>
If R is a relation from a set A to itself, that is, if R is a subset of A2 = A×A, then we say that R is a relation on A.<br>
The domain of a relation R is the set of all first elements of the ordered pairs which belong to R, and the
range is the set of second elements.<br>
Although n-ary relations, which involve ordered n-tuples, are introduced in Section 2.10, the term relation
shall then mean binary relation unless otherwise stated or implied.
<br><br><b>EXAMPLE 2.3</b><br>
(a) A = (1, 2, 3) and B = {x, y, z}, and let R = {(1, y), (1, z), (3, y)}.<br> Then R is a relation from A to B since R
is a subset of A × B.With respect to this relation,<br>
1Ry, 1Rz, 3Ry, but 1Rx, 2Rx, 2Ry, 2Rz, 3Rx, 3Rz<br>
The domain of R is {1, 3} and the range is {y, z}.<br>
(b) Set inclusion ? is a relation on any collection of sets. For, given any pair of set A and B, either A ? B
or A ? B.<br>
(c) A familiar relation on the set Z of integers is “m divides n.” A common notation for this relation is to write
m|n when m divides n. Thus 6 | 30 but 7 | 25.<br>
(d) Consider the set L of lines in the plane. Perpendicularity, written “?,” is a relation on L. That is, given any
pair of lines a and b, either a ?b or a?b. Similarly, “is parallel to,” written “||,” is a relation on L since
either a  b or a  b.<br>
(e) Let A be any set. An important relation on A is that of equality,<br>
{(a, a) | a ? A}<br>
which is usually denoted by “=.” This relation is also called the identity or diagonal relation on A and it will
also be denoted by A or simply .<br>
(f) Let A be any set. Then A × A and Ø are subsets of A × A and hence are relations on A called the universal
relation and empty relation, respectively.<br><br>
<b>Inverse Relation</b><br>
Let R be any relation from a set A to a set B. The inverse of R, denoted by R-1, is the relation from B to A
which consists of those ordered pairs which, when reversed, belong to R; that is,<br>
R-1 = {(b, a) | (a, b) ? R}<br>
For example, let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {x, y, z}. Then the inverse of<br>
R = {(1, y), (1, z), (3, y)} is R-1 = {(y, 1), (z, 1), (y, 3)}<br>
Clearly, if R is any relation, then (R-1)-1 = R. Also, the domain and range of R-1 are equal, respectively, to
the range and domain of R. Moreover, if R is a relation on A, then R-1 is also a relation on A.<br><br>
<b>2.4 PICTORIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF RELATIONS</b><br>
There are various ways of picturing relations.<br>
<b>Relations on R</b>
Let S be a relation on the set R of real numbers; that is, S is a subset of R<sup>2</sup> = R × R. Frequently, S consists
of all ordered pairs of real numbers which satisfy some given equation E(x, y) = 0 (such as x2 + y2 = 25).<br>
Since R2 can be represented by the set of points in the plane, we can picture S by emphasizing those points
in the plane which belong to S. The pictorial representation of the relation is sometimes called the graph of the
relation. For example, the graph of the relation x2+y2 = 25 is a circle having its center at the origin and radius 5.<br><br><br>
See Fig. 2-2(a).<br><br><img src="2.2.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br><br>
<b>Directed Graphs of Relations on Sets</b><br>
There is an important way of picturing a relation R on a finite set. First we write down the elements of the
set, and then we draw an arrow from each element x to each element y whenever x is related to y. This diagram
is called the directed graph of the relation. Figure 2-2(b), for example, shows the directed graph of the following
relation R on the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4}:<br>
R = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)}<br>
Observe that there is an arrow from 2 to itself, since 2 is related to 2 under R.<br>
These directed graphs will be studied in detail as a separate subject in Chapter 8.We mention it here mainly
for completeness.<br><br>
<b>Pictures of Relations on Finite Sets</b><br>
Suppose A and B are finite sets. There are two ways of picturing a relation R from A to B.<br>
(i) Form a rectangular array (matrix) whose rows are labeled by the elements of A and whose columns are
labeled by the elements of B. Put a 1 or 0 in each position of the array according as a ? A is or is not
related to b ? B. This array is called the matrix of the relation.<br><br>
(ii) Write down the elements of A and the elements of B in two disjoint disks, and then draw an arrow from
a ? Ato b ? B whenever a is related to b. This picture will be called the arrow diagram of the relation.
Figure 2-3 pictures the relation R in Example 2.3(a) by the above two ways.<br><img src="2.3.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>

<b>2.5 COMPOSITION OF RELATIONS</b><br>
Let A, B and C be sets, and let R be a relation from A to B and let S be a relation from B to C. That is, R is
a subset of A × B and S is a subset of B × C. Then R and S give rise to a relation from A to C denoted by R?S
and defined by:<br>
a(R?S)c if for some b ? B we have aRb and bSc<br>.
That is ,<br>
R ? S = {(a, c) | there exists b ? B for which (a, b) ? R and (b, c) ? S}<br>
The relation R?S is called the composition of R and S; it is sometimes denoted simply by RS.<br>
Suppose R is a relation on a set A, that is, R is a relation from a set A to itself. Then R?R, the composition
of R with itself, is always defined. Also, R?R is sometimes denoted by R2. Similarly, R3 = R2?R = R?R?R,
and so on. Thus Rn is defined for all positive n.<br><br>
<b>Warning:</b> Many texts denote the composition of relations R and S by S?R rather than R?S. This is done in order
to conform with the usual use of g?f to denote the composition of f and g where f and g are functions. Thus the
reader may have to adjust this notation when using this text as a supplement with another text. However, when a
relation R is composed with itself, then the meaning of R?R is unambiguous.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.4</b> Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {a, b, c, d}, C = {x, y, z} and let<br>
R = {(1, a), (2, d), (3, a), (3, b), (3, d)} and S = {(b, x), (b, z), (c, y), (d, z)}<br>
Consider the arrow diagrams of R and S as in Fig. 2-4. Observe that there is an arrow from 2 to d which is followed
by an arrow from d to z. We can view these two arrows as a “path” which “connects” the element 2 ? A to the
element z ? C. Thus:<br>
2(R ? S)z since 2Rd and dSz<br>
Similarly there is a path from 3 to x and a path from 3 to z. Hence<br>
3(R?S)x and 3(R?S)z<br>
No other element of A is connected to an element of C. Accordingly,<br>
R ? S = {(2, z), (3, x), (3, z)}<br>
Our first theorem tells us that composition of relations is associative.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 2.1:</b> Let A, B, C and D be sets. Suppose R is a relation from A to B, S is a relation from B to C, and
T is a relation from C to D. Then<br>
(R ? S) ? T = R ? (S ? T )<br>
We prove this theorem in Problem 2.8.<br>
<br><img src="2.4.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">

<br>

<b>Composition of Relations and Matrices</b><br>
There is another way of finding R?S. Let MR and MS denote respectively the matrix representations of the
relations R and S. Then<br><img src="a.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<br>
The nonzero entries in this matrix tell us which elements are related by R?S. Thus M = MRMS and MR?S have
the same nonzero entries.<br><br>
<b>2.6 TYPES OF RELATIONS</b><br>
This section discusses a number of important types of relations defined on a set A.<br><br>
<b>Reflexive Relations</b><br>
A relation R on a set A is reflexive if aRa for every a ? A, that is, if (a, a) ? R for every a ? A. Thus R is
not reflexive if there exists a ? A such that (a, a) /? R.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.5</b> Consider the following five relations on the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4}:<br>
R1 = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (4, 4)}<br>
R2 = {(1, 1)(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)}<br>
R3 = {(1, 3), (2, 1)}<br>
R4 = Ø, the empty relation<br>
R5 = A × A, the universal relation<br>
Determine which of the relations are reflexive.<br><br>
Since A contains the four elements 1, 2, 3, and 4, a relation R on A is reflexive if it contains the four pairs
(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). Thus only R2 and the universal relation R5 = A × A are reflexive. Note that
R1,R3, and R4 are not reflexive since, for example, (2, 2) does not belong to any of them.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.6</b> Consider the following five relations:<br>
(1) Relation = (less than or equal) on the set Z of integers.<br>
(2) Set inclusion ? on a collection C of sets.<br>
(3) Relation ? (perpendicular) on the set L of lines in the plane.<br>
(4) Relation  (parallel) on the set L of lines in the plane.<br>
(5) Relation |of divisibility on the set N of positive integers. (Recall x |y if there exists z such that xz = y.)<br>
Determine which of the relations are reflexive.<br><br>

The relation (3) is not reflexive since no line is perpendicular to itself. Also (4) is not reflexive since no line
is parallel to itself. The other relations are reflexive; that is, x = x for every x ? Z, A ? A for any set A ? C,
and n | n for every positive integer n ? N.<br><br>
<b>Symmetric and Antisymmetric Relations</b><br>
A relation R on a set A is symmetric if whenever aRb then bRa, that is, if whenever (a, b) ? R then (b, a) ? R.
Thus R is not symmetric if there exists a, b ? A such that (a, b) ? R but (b, a) /? R.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.7</b>
(a) Determine which of the relations in Example 2.5 are symmetric.<br>
R1 is not symmetric since (1, 2) ? R1 but (2, 1) /? R1. R3 is not symmetric since (1, 3) ? R3 but (3, 1) /? R3.
The other relations are symmetric.
(b) Determine which of the relations in Example 2.6 are symmetric.<br>
The relation ? is symmetric since if line a is perpendicular to line b then b is perpendicular to a. Also,  is
symmetric since if line a is parallel to line b then b is parallel to line a. The other relations are not symmetric.<br>
For example:<br>
3 = 4 but 4 = 3; {1, 2} ? {1, 2, 3} but {1, 2, 3} ? {1, 2}; and 2 | 6 but 6| 2.<br>
A relation R on a set A is antisymmetric if whenever aRb and bRa then a = b, that is, if a = b and aRb then bRa.<br>
Thus R is not antisymmetric if there exist distinct elements a and b in A such that aRb and bRa.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.8</b>
(a) Determine which of the relations in Example 2.5 are antisymmetric.<br>
R2 is not antisymmetric since (1, 2) and (2, 1) belong to R2, but 1 = 2. Similarly, the universal relation R3
is not antisymmetric. All the other relations are antisymmetric.<br><br>
(b) Determine which of the relations in Example 2.6 are antisymmetric.<br>
The relation=is antisymmetric since whenever a = b and b = a then a = b. Set inclusion?is antisymmetric
since whenever A ? B and B ? A then A = B. Also, divisibility on N is antisymmetric since whenever
m| n and n |m then m = n. (Note that divisibility on Z is not antisymmetric since 3|-3 and -3 | 3 but
3 = -3.) The relations ? and  are not antisymmetric.<br><br>
<b>Remark:</b>The properties of being symmetric and being antisymmetric are not negatives of each other. For example,<br>
the relation R = {(1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3)} is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric. On the other hand, the relation
R'= {(1, 1), (2, 2)} is both symmetric and antisymmetric.<br><br>
<b>Transitive Relations</b><br>
A relation R on a set A is transitive if whenever aRb and bRc then aRc, that is, if whenever (a, b), (b, c) ? R
then (a, c) ? R. Thus R is not transitive if there exist a, b, c ? R such that (a, b), (b, c) ? R but (a, c) /? R.
<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.9</b>
(a) Determine which of the relations in Example 2.5 are transitive.<br>
The relation R3 is not transitive since (2, 1), (1, 3) ? R3 but (2, 3) /? R3. All the other relations are transitive.<br><br>
(b) Determine which of the relations in Example 2.6 are transitive.<br>
The relations =, ?, and | are transitive, but certainly not ?. Also, since no line is parallel to itself, we can
have a  b and b  a, but a  a. Thus  is not transitive. (We note that the relation “is parallel or equal to” is
a transitive relation on the set L of lines in the plane.)<br><br>
The property of transitivity can also be expressed in terms of the composition of relations. For a relation R on A
we did define R2 = R?R and, more generally, Rn = Rn-1?R. Then we have the following result:<br><br>
<b>Theorem 2.2:</b> A relation R is transitive if and only if, for every n = 1, we have Rn ? R.<br><br>
<b>2.7 CLOSURE PROPERTIES</b><br>
Consider a given set A and the collection of all relations on A. Let P be a property of such relations, such as
being symmetric or being transitive. A relation with property P will be called a P-relation. The P-closure of an
arbitrary relation R on A, written P(R), is a P-relation such that<br>
R ? P(R) ? S<br>
for every P-relation S containing R.We will write<br>
reflexive(R), symmetric(R), and transitive(R)<nbsp>
for the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closures of R.<br><br>
Generally speaking, P(R) need not exist. However, there is a general situation where P(R) will always
exist. Suppose P is a property such that there is at least one P-relation containing R and that the intersection of
any P-relations is again a P-relation. Then one can prove (Problem 2.16) that<br>
P(R) = n(S | S is a P-relation and R ? S)<br>
Thus one can obtain P(R) from the “top-down,” that is, as the intersection of relations. However, one usually
wants to find P(R) from the “bottom-up,” that is, by adjoining elements to R to obtain P(R). This we do below.<br><br>
<b>Reflexive and Symmetric Closures</b><br>
The next theorem tells us how to obtain easily the reflexive and symmetric closures of a relation. Here
A = {(a, a) | a ? A} is the diagonal or equality relation on A.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 2.3:</b> Let R be a relation on a set A. Then:<br>
(i) R ? A is the reflexive closure of R.<br>
(ii) R ? R-1 is the symmetric closure of R.<br>
In other words, reflexive(R) is obtained by simply adding to R those elements (a, a) in the diagonal which do not
already belong to R, and symmetric(R) is obtained by adding to R all pairs (b, a) whenever (a, b) belongs to R.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE2.10</b> Consider the relationR = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3)}on the setA = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Then<br>
reflexive(R) = R ? {(2, 2), (4, 4)} and symmetric(R) = R ? {(4, 2), (3, 4)}<br><br>
<b>Transitive Closure</b><br>
Let R be a relation on a set A. Recall that R2 = R?R and Rn = Rn-1?R.We define<br>
R* =
8
i=1
Ri<br>
The following theorem applies:<br><br>
<b>Theorem 2.4:</b> R* is the transitive closure of R.<br>
Suppose A is a finite set with n elements.This gives us the following theorem:<br><br>
<b>Theorem 2.5:</b> Let R be a relation on a set A with n elements. Then<br>
transitive (R) = R ? R2 ? . . . ? Rn<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.11</b> Consider the relation R = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)} on A = {1, 2, 3}. Then:<br>
R2 = R?R = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)} and R3 = R2?R = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}<br>
Accordingly,<br>
transitive (R) = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (1, 3)}<br><br>
<b>2.8 EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS</b><br>
Consider a nonempty set S. A relation R on S is an equivalence relation if R is reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive. That is, R is an equivalence relation on S if it has the following three properties:<br><br>
(1) For every a ? S, aRa. <nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>(2) If aRb, then bRa.<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp> (3) If aRb and bRc, then aRc.<br>
The general idea behind an equivalence relation is that it is a classification of objects which are in some way
“alike.” In fact, the relation “=” of equality on any set S is an equivalence relation; that is:<br>
(1) a = a for every a ? S.<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp> (2) If a = b, then b = a. <nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>(3) If a = b, b = c,<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>then a = c.<br>
Other equivalence relations follow.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.12</b><br>
(a) Let L be the set of lines and let T be the set of triangles in the Euclidean plane.<br>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>(i) The relation “is parallel to or identical to” is an equivalence relation on L.<br>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>(ii) The relations of congruence and similarity are equivalence relations on T.<br>
(b) The relation ? of set inclusion is not an equivalence relation. It is reflexive and transitive, but it is not
symmetric since A ? B does not imply B ? A.<br>
(c) Let m be a fixed positive integer. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo m, written<br>
a = b (mod m)<br>
if m divides a - b. For example, for the modulus m = 4, we have<br>
11 = 3 (mod 4) and 22 = 6 (mod 4)<br>
since 4 divides 11-3 = 8 and 4 divides 22-6 = 16. This relation of congruence modulo m is an important
equivalence relation.<br><br>
<b>Equivalence Relations and Partitions</b><br>
This subsection explores the relationship between equivalence relations and partitions on a non-empty set S.<br>
Recall first that a partition P of S is a collection {Ai} of nonempty subsets of S with the following two properties:<br>
(1) Each a ? S belongs to some Ai .<br>
(2) If Ai = Aj then Ai n Aj = Ø.<br>
In other words, a partition P of S is a subdivision of S into disjoint nonempty sets. (See Section 1.7.)<br>
Suppose R is an equivalence relation on a set S. For each a ? S, let [a] denote the set of elements of S to
which a is related under R; that is:<br>
[a] = {x | (a, x) ? R}<br>
We call [a] the equivalence class of a in S; any b ? [a] is called a representative of the equivalence class.
The collection of all equivalence classes of elements of S under an equivalence relation R is denoted by S/R,
that is,<br>
S/R = {[a] | a ? S}<br>
It is called the quotient set of S by R. The fundamental property of a quotient set is contained in the following
theorem.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 2.6:</b> Let R be an equivalence relation on a set S. Then S/R is a partition of S. Specifically:<br>
(i) For each a in S, we have a ? [a].<br>
(ii) [a] = [b] if and only if (a, b) ? R.<br>
(iii) If [a] = [b], then [a] and [b] are disjoint.<br>
Conversely, given a partition {Ai } of the set S, there is an equivalence relation R on S such that the sets Ai are
the equivalence classes.<br><br>
This important theorem will be proved in Problem 2.17.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.13</b><br>
(a) Consider the relation R = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)} on S = {1, 2, 3}.<br>
One can show that R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, that is, that R is an equivalence relation. Also:<br>
[1] = {1, 2}, [2] = {1, 2}, [3] = {3}<br>
Observe that [1] = [2] and that S/R = {[1], [3]} is a partition of S. One can choose either {1, 3} or {2, 3} as
a set of representatives of the equivalence classes.<br>
(b) Let R5 be the relation of congruence modulo 5 on the set Z of integers denoted by<br>
x = y (mod 5)<br>
This means that the difference x -y is divisible by 5. Then R5 is an equivalence relation on Z. The quotient
set Z/R5 contains the following five equivalence classes:<br>
A0 = {. . . ,-10,-5, 0, 5, 10, . . .}<br>
A1 = {. . . ,-9,-4, 1, 6, 11, . . .}<br>
A2 = {. . . ,-8,-3, 2, 7, 12, . . .}<br>
A3 = {. . . ,-7,-2, 3, 8, 13, . . .}<br>
A4 = {. . . ,-6,-1, 4, 9, 14, . . .}<br>
Any integer x, uniquely expressed in the form x = 5q +r where 0 = r < 5, is a member of the equivalence
class Ar , where r is the remainder.As expected, Z is the disjoint union of equivalence classes A1,A2,A3,A4.<br>
Usually one chooses {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} or {-2,-1, 0, 1, 2} as a set of representatives of the equivalence classes.<br><br>
<b>2.9 PARTIAL ORDERING RELATIONS</b><br>
A relation R on a set S is called a partial ordering or a partial order of S if R is reflexive, antisymmetric, and
transitive. A set S together with a partial ordering R is called a partially ordered set or poset. Partially ordered
sets will be studied in more detail in Chapter 14, so here we simply give some examples.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 2.14</b>
(a) The relation ? of set inclusion is a partial ordering on any collection of sets since set inclusion has the three
desired properties. That is,<br>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>(1) A ? A for any set A.<br>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>(2) If A ? B and B ? A, then A = B.<br>
<nbsp><nbsp><nbsp><nbsp>(3) If A ? B and B ? C, then A ? C.<br>
(b) The relation = on the set R of real numbers is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Thus = is a partial
ordering on R.<br>
(c) The relation “a divides b,” written a | b, is a partial ordering on the set N of positive integers. However, “a
divides b” is not a partial ordering on the set Z of integers since a | b and b | a need not imply a = b.<br> For
example, 3|-3 and -3 | 3 but 3 = -3.<br><br>
</p><br><h1 style="text-align:left;"><b><u>Functions</u></b></h1><br><p><b>3.1 INTRODUCTION</b><br>
One of the most important concepts in mathematics is that of a function. The terms “map,” “mapping,”
“transformation,” and many others mean the same thing; the choice of which word to use in a given situation is
usually determined by tradition and the mathematical background of the person using the term.<br>
Related to the notion of a function is that of an algorithm. The notation for presenting an algorithm and a
discussion of its complexity is also covered in this chapter.<br><br>
<b>3.2 FUNCTIONS</b><br>
Suppose that to each element of a set A we assign a unique element of a set B; the collection of such
assignments is called a function from A into B. The set A is called the domain of the function, and the set B is
called the target set or codomain.<br>
Functions are ordinarily denoted by symbols. For example, let f denote a function from A into B. Then we
write<br>
f: A ? B<br>
which is read: “f is a function from A into B,” or “f takes (or maps) A into B.” If a ? A, then f (a) (read: “f of a”)
denotes the unique element of B which f assigns to a; it is called the image of a under f, or the value of f at a.<br>
The set of all image values is called the range or image of f. The image of f : A ? B is denoted by Ran(f ),
Im(f ) or f (A).<br><br>
Frequently, a function can be expressed by means of a mathematical formula. For example, consider the
function which sends each real number into its square.We may describe this function by writing<br>
f (x) = x2 or x ? x2 or y = x2<br>
In the first notation, x is called a variable and the letter f denotes the function. In the second notation, the barred
arrow ?is read “goes into.” In the last notation, x is called the independent variable and y is called the dependent
variable since the value of y will depend on the value of x.<br>
<b>Remark:</b> Whenever a function is given by a formula in terms of a variable x, we assume, unless it is otherwise
stated, that the domain of the function is R (or the largest subset of R for which the formula has meaning) and
the codomain is R.<br><br><br>
<img src="3.1.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<br>
<b>EXAMPLE 3.1</b><br>
(a) Consider the function f (x) = x3, i.e., f assigns to each real number its cube. Then the image of 2 is 8, and
so we may write f (2) = 8.<br>
(b) Figure 3-1 defines a function f from A = {a, b, c, d} into B = {r, s, t , u} in the obvious way. Here
f (a) = s, f (b) = u, f (c) = r, f (d) = s<br>
The image of f is the set of image values, {r, s, u}. Note that t does not belong to the image of f because t is
not the image of any element under f.<br>
(c) Let A be any set. The function from A into A which assigns to each element in A the element itself is called
the identity function on A and it is usually denoted by 1A, or simply 1. In other words, for every a ? A,
1A(a) = a.<br>
(d) Suppose S is a subset of A, that is, suppose S ? A. The inclusion map or embedding of S into A, denoted by
i: S ? A is the function such that, for every x ? S,
i(x) = x<br><br>
The restriction of any function f: A ? B, denoted by f |S is the function from S into B such that, for any x ? S,
f |S(x) = f (x)<br><br>
<b>Functions as Relations</b><br>
There is another point of view from which functions may be considered. First of all, every function f: A ? B
gives rise to a relation from A to B called the graph of f and defined by<br>
Graph of f = {(a, b) | a ? A, b = f (a)}<br>
Two functions f : A ? B and g: A ? B are defined to be equal, written f = g, if f (a) = g(a) for every
a ? A; that is, if they have the same graph. Accordingly, we do not distinguish between a function and its graph.
Now, such a graph relation has the property that each a in A belongs to a unique ordered pair (a, b) in the relation.
On the other hand, any relation f from A to B that has this property gives rise to a function f : A ? B, where
f (a) = b for each (a, b) in f. Consequently, one may equivalently define a function as follows:<br><br>
<b>Definition:</b>A function f: A ? B is a relation from A to B (i.e., a subset of A×B) such that each a ? A belongs
to a unique ordered pair (a, b) in f.<br>
Although we do not distinguish between a function and its graph, we will still use the terminology “graph
of f ” when referring to f as a set of ordered pairs. Moreover, since the graph of f is a relation, we can draw its
picture as was done for relations in general, and this pictorial representation is itself sometimes called the graph
of f. Also, the defining condition of a function, that each a ? A belongs to a unique pair (a, b) in f, is equivalent
to the geometrical condition of each vertical line intersecting the graph in exactly one point.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 3.2</b>
(a) Let f: A ? B be the function defined in Example 3.1 <br>(b). Then the graph of f is as follows:
{(a, s), (b, u), (c, r), (d, s)}<br>
(b) Consider the following three relations on the set A = {1, 2, 3}:<br>
f = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1)}, g= {(1, 2), (3, 1)}, h= {(1, 3), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1)}<br>
f is a function from A into A since each member of A appears as the first coordinate in exactly one ordered
pair in f; here f (1) = 3, f (2) = 3, and f (3) = 1. g is not a function from A into A since 2 ? A is not the
first coordinate of any pair in g and so g does not assign any image to 2. Also h is not a function from A into
A since 1 ? A appears as the first coordinate of two distinct ordered pairs in h, (1, 3) and (1, 2). If h is to be
a function it cannot assign both 3 and 2 to the element 1 ? A.<br>
(c) By a real polynomial function, we mean a function f: R ? R of the form<br>
f (x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 +· · ·+a1x + a0<br>
where the ai are real numbers. Since R is an infinite set, it would be impossible to plot each point of the
graph. However, the graph of such a function can be approximated by first plotting some of its points and then
drawing a smooth curve through these points. The points are usually obtained from a table where various
values are assigned to x and the corresponding values of f (x) are computed. Figure 3-2 illustrates this
technique using the function f (x) = x2 - 2x - 3.<br><br> <img src="3.2.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"> <br>





<b>Composition Function</b><br>
Consider functions f: A ? B and g: B ? C; that is, where the codomain of f is the domain of g. Then we
may define a new function from A to C, called the composition of f and g and written g?f , as follows:<br>
(g?f )(a) = g(f (a))<br>
That is, we find the image of a under f and then find the image of f (a) under g. This definition is not really
new. If we view f and g as relations, then this function is the same as the composition of f and g as relations (see
Section 2.6) except that here we use the functional notation g?f for the composition of f and g instead of the
notation f ?g which was used for relations.<br>

Consider any function f: A ? B. Then<br>
f ?1A = f and 1B?f = f<br>
where 1A and 1B are the identity functions on A and B, respectively.<br><br>
<b>3.3 ONE-TO-ONE, ONTO, AND INVERTIBLE FUNCTIONS</b><br>
A function f : A ? B is said to be one-to-one (written 1-1) if different elements in the domain A have
distinct images. Another way of saying the same thing is that f is one-to-one if f (a) = f (a)' implies a = a<br><br>
	.
A function f: A ? B is said to be an onto function if each element of B is the image of some element of A.<br>
In other words, f : A ? B is onto if the image of f is the entire codomain, i.e., if f (A) = B. In such a case we
say that f is a function from A onto B or that f maps A onto B.<br>
A function f: A ? B is invertible if its inverse relation f
<sup>-1</sup> is a function from B to A. In general, the inverse
relation f<sup>-1</sup> may not be a function. The following theorem gives simple criteria which tells us when it is.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 3.1:</b> A function f: A ? B is invertible if and only if f is both one-to-one and onto.<br>
If f : A ? B is one-to-one and onto, then f is called a one-to-one correspondence between A and B. This
terminology comes from the fact that each element of A will then correspond to a unique element of B and vice
versa.<br>
Some texts use the terms injective for a one-to-one function, surjective for an onto function, and bijective for
a one-to-one correspondence.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 3.3</b> Consider the functions f1: A ? B, f2: B ? C, f3: C ? D and f4: D ? E defined by the
diagram of Fig. 3-3. Now f1 is one-to-one since no element of B is the image of more than one element of A.
Similarly, f2 is one-to-one. However, neither f3 nor f4 is one-to-one since f3(r) = f3(u) and f4(v) = f4(w)<br><br>
<img src="3.3.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<br>
As far as being onto is concerned, f2 and f3 are both onto functions since every element of C is the image
under f2 of some element of B and every element of D is the image under f3 of some element of C, f2(B) = C
and f3(C) = D. On the other hand, f1 is not onto since 3 ? B is not the image under f4 of any element of A.
and f4 is not onto since x ? E is not the image under f4 of any element of D.<br>
Thus f1 is one-to-one but not onto, f3 is onto but not one-to-one and f4 is neither one-to-one nor onto.
However, f2 is both one-to-one and onto, i.e., is a one-to-one correspondence between A and B. Hence f2 is
invertible and f<sup>-1</sup>
2 is a function from C to B.<br><br>
<b>Geometrical Characterization of One-to-One and Onto Functions</b>
Consider now functions of the form f : R ? R. Since the graphs of such functions may be plotted
in the Cartesian plane R2 and since functions may be identified with their graphs, we might wonder
whether the concepts of being one-to-one and onto have some geometrical meaning. The answer is yes.<br>
Specifically:<br>
(1) f :R ? R is one-to-one if each horizontal line intersects the graph of f in at most one point.<br>
(2) f :R ? R is an onto function if each horizontal line intersects the graph of f at one or more points.<br>
Accordingly, if f is both one-to-one and onto, i.e. invertible, then each horizontal line will intersect the graph of
f at exactly one point.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 3.4</b> Consider the following four functions from R into R:<br>
f1(x) = x2, f2(x) = 2x, f3(x) = x3 - 2x2 - 5x + 6, f4(x) = x3<br>
The graphs of these functions appear in Fig. 3-4. Observe that there are horizontal lines which intersect the graph
of f1 twice and there are horizontal lines which do not intersect the graph of f1 at all; hence f1 is neither oneto-
one nor onto. Similarly, f2 is one-to-one but not onto, f3 is onto but not one-to-one and f4 is both one-to-one
and onto. The inverse of f4 is the cube root function, i.e., f4<sup>-1</sup>
(x) = cube root x
<br><br><img src="3.4.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br><br><b>3.6 RECURSIVELY DEFINED FUNCTIONS</b><br>
A function is said to be recursively defined if the function definition refers to itself. In order for the definition
not to be circular, the function definition must have the following two properties:<br>
(1) There must be certain arguments, called base values, for which the function does not refer to itself.<br>
(2) Each time the function does refer to itself, the argument of the function must be closer to a base value.<br>
A recursive function with these two properties is said to be well-defined.<br>
The following examples should help clarify these ideas.<br><br>
<b>Factorial Function</b><br>
The product of the positive integers from 1 to n, inclusive, is called “n factorial” and is usually denoted by n!.
That is,<br>
n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1<br>
It is also convenient to define 0! = 1, so that the function is defined for all nonnegative integers. Thus:<br>
0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2 · 1 = 2, 3! = 3 · 2 · 1 = 6, 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24<br>
5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120, 6! = 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 720<br>
And so on. Observe that<br>
5! = 5 · 4! = 5 · 24 = 120 and 6! = 6 · 5! = 6 · 120 = 720<br>
This is true for every positive integer n; that is,<br>
n! = n · (n - 1)!<br>
Accordingly, the factorial function may also be defined as follows:<br><br>
<b>Definition 3.1 (Factorial Function):</b><br>
(a) If n = 0, then n! = 1.<br>
(b) If n > 0, then n! = n · (n - 1)!<br>
Observe that the above definition of n! is recursive, since it refers to itself when it uses (n - 1)!. However:<br>
(1) The value of n! is explicitly given when n = 0 (thus 0 is a base value).<br>
(2) The value of n! for arbitrary n is defined in terms of a smaller value of n which is closer to the base
value 0.<br>
Accordingly, the definition is not circular, or, in other words, the function is well-defined.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 3.8</b> Figure 3-6 shows the nine steps to calculate 4! using the recursive definition. Specifically:<br>
Step 1. This defines 4! in terms of 3!, so we must postpone evaluating 4! until we evaluate 3. This postponement
is indicated by indenting the next step.<br>
Step 2. Here 3! is defined in terms of 2!, so we must postpone evaluating 3! until we evaluate 2!.<br>
Step 3. This defines 2! in terms of 1!.<br>
Step 4. This defines 1! in terms of 0!.<br>
Step 5. This step can explicitly evaluate 0!, since 0 is the base value of the recursive definition.<br>
Steps 6 to 9.We backtrack, using 0! to find 1!, using 1! to find 2!, using 2! to find 3!, and finally using 3! to
find 4!. This backtracking is indicated by the “reverse” indention.<br><br>
Observe that we backtrack in the reverse order of the original postponed evaluations.<br><br>
<img src="3.6.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br><b>Level Numbers</b><br>
Let P be a procedure or recursive formula which is used to evaluate f (X) where f is a recursive function
and X is the input.We associate a level number with each execution of P as follows. The original execution of P
is assigned level 1; and each time P is executed because of a recursive call, its level is one more than the level
of the execution that made the recursive call. The depth of recursion in evaluating f (X) refers to the maximum
level number of P during its execution.<br><br>
Consider, for example, the evaluation of 4! Example 3.8, which uses the recursive formula n! = n(n - 1)!.<br>
Step 1 belongs to level 1 since it is the first execution of the formula. Thus:<br>
Step 2 belongs to level 2; Step 3 to level 3, . . . ; Step 5 to level 5.
On the other hand, Step 6 belongs to level 4 since it is the result of a return from level 5. In other words, Step 6
and Step 4 belong to the same level of execution. Similarly,
Step 7 belongs to level 3; Step 8 to level 2; and Step 9 to level 1.<br>
Accordingly, in evaluating 4!, the depth of the recursion is 5.<br><br>
<b>Fibonacci Sequence</b>
The celebrated Fibonacci sequence (usually denoted by F0, F1, F2, . . .) is as follows:<br>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, . . .<br>
That is, F0 = 0 and F1 = 1 and each succeeding term is the sum of the two preceding terms. For example, the
next two terms of the sequence are<br>
34 + 55 = 89 and 55 + 89 = 144<br>
A formal definition of this function follows:<br><br>
<b>Definition 3.2 (Fibonacci Sequence):</b>
(a) If n = 0, or n = 1, then Fn = n.<br>
(b) If n > 1, then Fn = Fn-2 + Fn-1.<br>
This is another example of a recursive definition, since the definition refers to itself when it uses Fn-2 and
Fn-1 However:<br>
(1) The base values are 0 and 1.<br>
(2) The value of Fn is defined in terms of smaller values of n which are closer to the base values.<br>
Accordingly, this function is well-defined.<br><br>
