 <p><b>15.1 INTRODUCTION</b><br>
Both sets and propositions satisfy similar laws, which are listed in Tables 1-1 and 4-1 (in Chapters 1 and 4,
respectively). These laws are used to define an abstract mathematical structure called a Boolean algebra, which
is named after the mathematician George Boole (1815–1864).<br><br>
<b>15.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS</b><br>
Let B be a nonempty set with two binary operations + and *, a unary operation 	, and two distinct elements
0 and 1. Then B is called a Boolean algebra if the following axioms hold where a, b, c are any elements in B:<br><br>
[B1] Commutative laws:<br>
(1a) a + b = b + a <br>(1b) a * b = b * a<br>
[B2] Distributive laws:<br>
(2a) a + (b * c) = (a + b) * (a + c) <br>(2b) a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)<br>
[B3] Identity laws:<br>
(3a) a + 0 = a <br>(3b) a * 1 = a<br>
[B4] Complement laws:<br>
(4a) a + a=1 <br>(4b) a * a= 0<br><br>
We will sometimes designate a Boolean algebra by (B,+, *,', 0, 1*) when we want to emphasize its six parts.
We say 0 is the zero element, l, is the unit element, and a is the complement of a.We will usually drop the symbol
* and use  juxtaposition instead. Then (2b) is written a(b + c) = ab + ac which is the familiar algebraic identity
of rings and fields. However, (2a) becomes a + bc = (a + b)(a + c), which is certainly not a usual identity
in algebra.<br><br>
The operations +, *, and ' are called sum, product, and complement, respectively. We adopt the usual
convention that, unless we are guided by parentheses, 	 has precedence over *, and * has precedence over +.<br>
For example,
a + b * c means a + (b * c) and not (a + b) * c; a * b
	 means a * (b') and not (a * b)'<br><br>
	
Of course when a + b * c is written a + bc then the meaning is clear.<br><br>
<b>Subalgebras, Isomorphic Boolean Algebras</b><br>
Suppose C is a nonempty subset of a Boolean algebra B. We say C is a subalgebra of B if C itself is a
Boolean algebra (with respect to the operations of B). We note that C is a subalgebra of B if and only if C is
closed under the three operations of B, i.e., +, *, and 	. For example, {1, 2, 35, 70} is a subalgebra of D70 in
Example 15.1(c).<br>
Two Boolean algebras B and B are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence f: B ? B<br>
	
which preserves the three operations, i.e., such that, for any elements, a, b in B,<br>
f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b), f(a * b) = f (a) * f (b) and f (a') = f (a)'<br><br>
	
<b>15.3 DUALITY</b><br>
The dual of any statement in a Boolean algebra B is the statement obtained by interchanging the operations
+ and *, and interchanging their identity elements 0 and 1 in the original statement. For example, the dual of<br>
(1 + a) * (b + 0) = b is (0 * a) + (b * 1) = b<br>
Observe the symmetry in the axioms of a Boolean algebra B. That is, the dual of the set of axioms of B is the
same as the original set of axioms. Accordingly, the important principle of duality holds in B. Namely,<br><br>
<b>Theorem 15.1 (Principle of Duality):</b> The dual of any theorem in a Boolean algebra is also a theorem.<br>
In other words, if any statement is a consequence of the axioms of a Boolean algebra, then the dual is also a
consequence of those axioms since the dual statement can be proven by using the dual of each step of the proof
of the original statement.<br><br>

<b>15.4 BASIC THEOREMS</b><br>
Using the axioms [B1] through [B4], we prove (Problem 15.5) the following theorem.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 15.2:</b> Let a, b, c be any elements in a Boolean algebra B.<br>
(i) Idempotent laws:<br>
(5a) a + a =a <br>(5b) a * a = a<br>
(ii) Boundedness laws:<br>
(6a) a + 1 = 1 <br>(6b) a * 0 = 0<br>
(iii) Absorption laws:<br>
(7a) a + (a * b) =a<br> (7b) a * (a + b) = a<br>
(iv) Associative laws:<br>
(8a) (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) <br>(8b) (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)<br><br>
Theorem 15.2 and our axioms still do not contain all the properties of sets listed in Table 1-1. The next
two theorems give us the remaining properties.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 15.3:</b> Let a be any element of a Boolean algebra B.<br>
(i) (Uniqueness of Complement) If a + x = 1 and a * x = 0, then x = a	.
(ii) (Involution law) (a')' = a.
(iii) (9a) 0' = 1. (9b) 1' = 0.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 15.4 (DeMorgan’s laws):</b> (10a) (a + b)'= a'* b"<br>(10b) (a * b)'= a'*b'<br>
We prove these theorems in Problems 15.6 and 15.7.<br><br>
<b>15.10 LOGIC GATES AND CIRCUITS</b><br>
Logic circuits (also called logic networks) are structures which are built up from certain elementary circuits
called logic gates. Each logic circuit may be viewed as a machine L which contains one or more input devices
and exactly one output device. Each input device in L sends a signal, specifically, a bit (binary digit),<br>
0 or 1<br>
to the circuit L, and L processes the set of bits to yield an output bit. Accordingly, an n-bit sequence may be
assigned to each input device, and L processes the input sequences one bit at a time to produce an n-bit output
sequence. First we define the logic gates, and then we investigate the logic circuits.<br><br>
<b>Logic Gates</b><br>
There are three basic logic gates which are described below.We adopt the convention that the lines entering
the gate symbol from the left are input lines and the single line on the right is the output line.<br>
<b>(a) OR Gate:</b> Figure 15-8(a) shows an OR gate with inputs A and B and output Y = A + B where “addition”
is defined by the “truth table” in Fig. 15-8(b). Thus the output Y = 0 only when inputs A = 0 and B = 0.
Such an OR gate may, have more than two inputs. Figure 15-8(c) shows an OR gate with four inputs, A, B,
C, D, and output Y = A + B + C + D. The output Y = 0 if and only if all the inputs are 0.<br><img src="15.8.png" alt="img" style="width:800px;height:300px;"><br>
Suppose, for instance, the input data for the OR gate in Fig. 15-15(c) are the following 8-bit sequences:<br>
A = 10000101, B= 10100001, C= 00100100, 10010101<br>
The OR gate only yields 0 when all input bits are 0. This occurs only in the 2nd, 5th, and 7th positions
(reading from left to right). Thus the output is the sequence Y = 10110101.<br><br>
<b>(b) AND Gate:</b> Figure 15-9(a) shows an AND gate with inputs A and B and output Y = A · B (or simply
Y = AB) where “multiplication” is defined by the “truth table” in Fig. 15-9(b). Thus the output Y = 1 when
inputsA = 1 and B = 1; otherwise Y = 0. Such anANDgate may have more than two inputs. Figure 15-9(c)
shows an AND gate with four inputs, A, B, C, D, and output Y = A · B · C · D. The output Y = 1 if and
only if all the inputs are 1.<br>
Suppose, for instance, the input data for theAND gate in Fig. 15-9(c) are the following 8-bit sequences:<br>
A = 11100111, B= 01111011, C= 01110011, D= 11101110<br>
The AND gate only yields 1 when all input bits are 1. This occurs only in the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th positions.
Thus the output is the sequence Y = 01100010.<br><img src="15.9.png" alt="img" style="width:800px;height:300px;"><br>
<b>(c) NOT Gate:</b> Figure 15-10(a) shows a NOT gate, also called an inverter, with input A and output Y = A
	
where “inversion,” denoted by the prime, is defined by the “truth table” in Fig. 15-10(b). The value of
the output Y = A' is the opposite of the input A; that is, A'= 1 when A = 0 and A'= 0 when A = 1.
We emphasize that aNOTgate can have only one input, whereas theORandANDgates may have two or more
inputs.<br>
<img src="15.10.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<br>

Suppose, for instance, a NOT gate is asked to process the following three sequences:<br>
A1 = 110001, A2 = 10001111, A3 = 101100111000<br>
The NOT gate changes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0. Thus<br>
A1= 001110, A2= 01110000, A3= 010011000111<br>
are the three corresponding outputs.<br><br>
<b>Logic Circuits</b><br>
A logic circuit L is a well-formed structure whose elementary components are the above OR, AND, and
NOT gates. Figure 15-11 is an example of a logic circuit with inputs A, B, C and output Y . A dot indicates a
place where the input line splits so that its bit signal is sent in more than one direction. (Frequently, for notational
convenience, we may omit the word from the interior of the gate symbol.)Working from left to right, we express
Y in terms of the inputs A, B, C as follows. The output of the AND gate is A · B, which is then negated to yield
(A · B)'. The output of the lower OR gate is A'+ C, which is then negated to yield (A'+ C)'. The output of the
OR gate on the right, with inputs (A · B)'and (A' + C)', gives us our desired representation, that is,<br>
Y = (A · B)' + (A'+ C)<br><br>

<img src="15.11.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
<br>
<b>Logic Circuits as a Boolean Algebra</b><br>
Observe that the truth tables for the OR, AND, and NOT gates are respectively identical to the truth tables
for the propositions p ? q (disjunction, “p or q”), p ? q (conjunction, “p and q”), and ¬p (negation, “not p”),
which appear in Section 4.3. The only difference is that 1 and 0 are used instead of T and F. Thus the logic circuits
satisfy the same laws as do propositions and hence they form a Boolean algebra.We state this result formally.<br><br>
<b>Theorem 15.12:</b> Logic circuits form a Boolean Algebra.<br>
Accordingly, all terms used with Boolean algebras, such as, complements, literals, fundamental products,
minterms, sum-of-products, and complete sum-of-products, may also be used with our logic circuits.<br><br>
<b>AND-OR Circuits</b><br>
The logic circuit L which corresponds to a Boolean sum-of-products expression is called anAND-OR circuit.
Such a circuit L has several inputs, where:<br>
(1) Some of the inputs or their complements are fed into each AND gate.<br>
(2) The outputs of all the AND gates are fed into a single OR gate.<br>
(3) The output of the OR gate is the output for the circuit L.<br>
The following illustrates this type of a logic circuit.<br><br>
<b>NAND and NOR Gates</b><br>
There are two additional gates which are equivalent to combinations of the above basic gates.<br>
(a) A NAND gate, pictured in Fig. 15-13(a), is equivalent to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.<br>
(b) A NOR gate, pictured in Fig. 15-13(b), is equivalent to an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.<br>
The truth tables for these gates (using two inputs A and B) appear in Fig. 15-13(c). The NAND and NOR
gates can actually have two or more inputs just like the corresponding AND and OR gates. Furthermore, the
output of a NAND gate is 0 if and only if all the inputs are 1, and the output of a NOR gate is 1 if and only if
all the inputs are 0.<br>               

<img src="15.13.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;">

<br>
Observe that the only difference between theAND and NAND gates between the OR and NOR gates is that
the NAND and NOR gates are each followed by a circle. Some texts also use such a small circle to indicate a
complement before a gate. For example, the Boolean expressions corresponding to two logic circuits in Fig. 15-14
are as follows:<br>
(a) Y = (A'B)', (b) Y = (A'+ B'+ C)'<br><br>
	
<br><img src="15.14.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>

<b>15.11 TRUTH TABLES, BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS</b><br>
Consider a logic circuit L with n = 3 input devices A, B, C and output Y , say<br>
Y = A · B · C + A · B
	 · C + A
	 · B<br>
Each assignment of a set of three bits to the inputs A, B, C yields an output bit for Y . All together there are
2n = 23 = 8 possible ways to assign bits to the inputs as follows:<br>
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111<br>
The assumption is that the sequence of first bits is assigned to A, the sequence of second bits to B, and the
sequence of third bits to C. Thus the above set of inputs may be rewritten in the form<br>
A = 00001111, B= 00110011, C= 01010101<br>
We emphasize that these three 2n = 8-bit sequences contain the eight possible combinations of the input bits.<br>
The truth table T = T (L) of the above circuit L consists of the output sequence Y that corresponds to the
input sequences A, B, C. This truth table T may be expressed using fractional or relational notation, that is,
T may be written in the form<br>
T (A,B,C) = Y or T (L) = [A,B,C; Y ]<br>
This form for the truth table forLis essentially the same as the truth table for a proposition discussed in Section 4.4.
The only difference is that here the values for A, B, C, and Y are written horizontally, whereas in Section 4.4
they are written vertically.<br><br>
Consider a logic circuitLwith n input devices. There are many ways to form n input sequencesA1,A2, . . . , An
so that they contain the 2n different possible combinations of the input bits. (Note that each sequence must contain
2n bits.) One assignment scheme is as follows:<br><br>
A1: Assign 2n-1 bits which are 0’s followed by 2n-1 bits which are 1’s.<br>
A2: Repeatedly assign 2n-2 bits which are 0’s followed by 2n-2 bits which are 1’s.<br>
A3: Repeatedly assign 2n-3 bits which are 0’s followed by 2n-3 bits which are 1’s.<br>
And so on. The sequences obtained in this way will be called special sequences. Replacing 0 by 1 and 1 by 0 in
the special sequences yields the complements of the special sequences.<br>
<b>Remark:</b> Assuming the input are the special sequences, we frequently do not need to distinguish between the
truth table<br>
T (L) = [A1,A2, . . . , An
;Y ]
and the output Y itself.<br><br>
<b>EXAMPLE 15.11</b><br>
(a) Suppose a logic circuit L has n = 4 input devices A, B, C, D. The 2n = 24 = 16-bit special sequences for
A, B, C, D follow:<br>
A = 0000000011111111, C= 00110011001100110011<br>
B = 0000111100001111, D= 01010101010101010101<br>
That is:<br>
(1) A begins with eight 0’s followed by eight 1’s. (Here 2n-1 = 23 = 8.)<br>
(2) B begins with four 0’s followed by four 1’s, and so on. (Here 2n-2 = 22 = 4.)<br>
(3) C begins with two 0’s followed by two 1’s, and so on. (Here 2n-3 = 21 = 2.)<br>
(4) D begins with one 0 followed by one 1, and so on. (Here 2n-4 = 20 = 1.)<br>
(b) Suppose a logic circuit L has n = 3 input devices A, B, C. The 2n = 23 = 8-bit special sequences for A, B,
C and their complements A<br><br>
	, B
	, C
	 are as follows:<br>
A = 00001111, B= 00110011, C= 01010101<br>
A
	 = 11110000, B
	 = 11001100, C
	 = 10101010<br>
Figure 15-15 contains a three-step algorithm for finding the truth table for a logic circuit L where the output
Y is given by a Boolean sum-of-products expression in the inputs.<br> <img src="15.15.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"> <br>
<b>EXAMPLE 15.12</b> Algorithm 15.5 is used to find the truth table T = T (L) of the logic circuit L in Fig. 15-12
or, equivalently, of the above Boolean sum-of-products expression<br>
Y = A · B · C + A · B
	 · C + A
	 · B<br>
(1) The special sequences and their complements appear in Example 15.14(b).<br>
(2) The products are as follows:<br>
A · B · C = 00000001, A· B
	 · C = 00000100, A
	 · B = 00110000<br>
(3) The sum is Y = 00110101<br>.
Accordingly,<br>
T (00001111, 00110011, 01010101) = 00110101<br>
or simply T (L) = 00110101 where we assume the input consists of the special sequences.
<br><br>
<b>Boolean Functions</b><br>
Let E be a Boolean expression with n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn. The entire discussion above can also be
applied to E where now the special sequences are assigned to the variables x1, x2, . . . , xn instead of the input
devices A1,A2, . . . , An. The truth table T = T (E) of E is defined in the same way as the truth table T = T (L)
for a logic circuit L. For example, the Boolean expression<br>
E = xyz + xy<br>
	
z + x
	
y<br>
which is analogous to the logic circuit L in Example 15.12, yields the truth table<br>
T (00001111, 00110011, 01010101) = 00110101<br>
or simply T (E) = 00110101, where we assume the input consists of the special sequences.<br>
<b>Remark:</b> The truth table for a Boolean expression E = E(x1, x2, . . . , xn) with n variables may also be viewed
as a “Boolean” function from Bn into B. (The Boolean algebras Bn and B = {0, 1} are defined in Example 15.1.)<br>
That is, each element in Bn is a list of n bits which when assigned to the list of variables in E produces an element
in B. The truth table T (E) of E is simply the graph of the function.<br><br>
<b>15.12 KARNAUGH MAPS</b><br>
Karnaugh maps, where minterms involving the same variables are represented by squares, are pictorial
devices for finding prime implicants and minimal forms for Boolean expressions involving at most six variables.
We will only treat the cases of two, three, and four variables. In the context of Karnaugh maps, we will sometimes
use the terms “squares” and “minterm” interchangeably. Recall that a minterm is a fundamental product which
involves all the variables, and that a complete sum-of-products expression is a sum of minterms.<br>
First we need to define the notion of adjacent products. Two fundamental products P1 and P2 are said to
be adjacent if P1 and P2 have the same variables and if they differ in exactly one literal. Thus there must be
an uncomplemented variable in one product and complemented in the other. In particular, the sum of two such
adjacent products will be a fundamental product with one less literal.<br><br>Case of Three Variables
The Karnaugh map corresponding to Boolean expressions E = E(x, y, z) with three variables x, y, z is
shown in Fig. 15-18(a). Recall that there are exactly eight minterms with three variables:<br>
xyz, xyz', xy'z', xy'z, x'yz, x'yz', x'y'z', x'y'z<br>
These minterms are listed so that they correspond to the eight squares in the Karnaugh map in the obvious way.
Furthermore, in order that every pair of adjacent products in Fig. 15-18(a) are geometrically adjacent, the
right and left edges of the map must be identified. This is equivalent to cutting out, bending, and gluing the
map along the identified edges to obtain the cylinder pictured in Fig. 15-18(b) where adjacent products are now
represented by squares with one edge in common.<br><img src="15.18.png" alt="img" style="width:750px;height:300px;"><br>
Viewing the Karnaugh map in Fig. 15-18(a) as a Venn diagram, the areas represented by the variables x, y,
and z are shown in Fig. 15-19. Specifically, the variable x is still represented by the points in the upper half of
the map, as shaded in Fig. 15-19(a), and the variable y is still represented by the points in the left half of the
map, as shaded in Fig. 15-19(b). The new variable z is represented by the points in the left and right quarters of
<br><img src="15.19.png" alt="img" style="width:850px;height:300px;"><br>
the map, as shaded in Fig. 15-19(c). Thus x', y', and z' are represented, respectively, by points in the lower half,
right half, and middle two quarters of the map.<br>
By a basic rectangle in the Karnaugh map with three variables, we mean a square, two adjacent squares, or four
squares which form a one-by-four or a two-by-two rectangle. These basic rectangles correspond to fundamental
products of three, two, and one literal, respectively. Moreover, the fundamental product represented by a basic
rectangle is the product of just those literals that appear in every square of the rectangle.<br>
Suppose a complete sum-of-products Boolean expression E = E(x, y, z) is represented in the Karnaugh
map by placing checks in the appropriate squares.Aprime implicant of E will be a maximal basic rectangle of E,
i.e., a basic rectangle contained in E which is not contained in any larger basic rectangle in E.Aminimal sum-ofproducts
form for E will consist of a minimal cover of E, that is, a minimal number of maximal basic rectangles
of E which together include all the squares of E.<br><br>
